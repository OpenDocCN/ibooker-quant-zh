  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technique gives an easy target for any candlestick pattern based on the
    size of a key candlestick inside the pattern. The *symmetrical exit* takes the
    distance of the high and low of the key candlestick and projects it from one of
    the extremities (depending on whether it is a bullish or bearish pattern).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note
  prefs:
  - PREF_H6
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *key candlestick* is the one used to determine the symmetrical target. Generally,
    it is the candlestick that either confirms the pattern or defines it. For instance,
    the key candlestick of a Doji pattern is the middle candlestick that resembles
    a plus sign, while the key candlestick of a Euphoria pattern is the third (and
    biggest) candlestick.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fixed holding period assumes that you must exit a pattern after a prespecified
    number of time periods. It is a relatively inflexible technique and assumes that
    the reaction must happen within a certain period of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main idea is that when a position is initiated after the validation of a
    candlestick pattern, a time counter begins and runs until the exit, regardless
    of the market price relative to the entry price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, a bullish Tweezers pattern is validated, and a position is initiated.
    Following a fixed holding period of 5, the position must be exited after five
    time periods. The fixed holding period technique assumes a time-dependent pattern,
    which is valid for a prespecified window.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main idea is that when a position is initiated after the validation of a
    candlestick pattern, you exit it only if you encounter another pattern, whether
    bullish or bearish. This means that the pattern is valid until the market shows
    you otherwise.
  prefs: []

    Following a variable holding period, the position is exited only if another pattern
    is encountered.

    open for extended periods of time, thus rendering the trades obsolete and meaningless.

    on two occasions, whichever comes first (symmetrical projection or appearance
    of another pattern). When you exit a position, you have a certain weight, for
    example 50%. This means that you will exit 50% of the position upon validating
    the symmetrical projection or the appearance of another pattern.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There comes a time when a pattern does not produce the expected reaction, and
    as you may have seen from the back-testing results, this is not uncommon. In such
    instances, you must be ready to limit the damage, which is done by creating *invalidation
    rules*. These rules, depending on the trader, can be objective or subjective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Patterns can be invalidated by risk management techniques such as stop-losses
    that are fixed by traders themselves or by volatility measures such as the ATR,
    which I previously discussed in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#chapter5).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that pattern invalidation is similar to an exit technique except it deals
    with exiting at a loss. However, the fixed holding period technique can be seen
    as both a target or an invalidation technique due to it being a risk-limiting
    approach (exiting after a certain amount of time) and a target approach (exiting
    after believing that the pattern could cause a reaction for a limited period of
    time).

- en: For example, a trader can always use 20 pips as a stop-loss for their EURUSD
    short-term trades. This means that if a pattern emerges and a buy order is initiated
    at $1.0000, whenever the market touches or breaks $0.9980, the position is automatically
    liquidated at a loss. In contrast, if the same trader uses the ATR-based technique
    to invalidate the pattern, they would exit if the market breaks the open price
    minus the ATR reading at initiation multiplied by a constant such as 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be clearer, suppose that the ATR has a value of 20\. Then, the stop-loss
    would be at $0.9960 (20 × 2 = 40).
