- en: Financial modeling has a long history with many successfully accomplished tasks,
    but at the same time it has been fiercely criticized due mainly to lack of *flexibility*
    and *non-inclusiveness* of the models. The 2007–2008 financial crisis fueled this
    debate as well as paved the way for innovations and different approaches in the
    field of financial modeling.

    of AI applications in finance. Two other drivers, data availability and increased
    computing power, have spurred the adoption of AI in finance and have intensified
    research in this area starting in the 1990s.

    The adoption of these use cases has been driven by both supply factors, such as
    technological advances and the availability of financial sector data and infrastructure,
    and by demand factors, such as profitability needs, competition with other firms,
    and the demands of financial regulation.

    with the adoption of AI in parallel with its ever-growing role in the financial
    decision-making process. In his celebrated book, Bostrom (2014) denotes that there
    are two important revolutions in the history of mankind: the Agricultural Revolution
    and the Industrial Revolution. These two revolutions have had such a profound
    impact that any third revolution of similar magnitude would double the size of
    the world economy in two weeks. Even more strikingly, if the third revolution
    were accomplished by AI, the impact would be way more profound.'

    in finance so that predictive and measurement performance of financial models
    can be improved. Parametric models suffer from issues of low variance and high
    bias; machine learning models, with their flexibility, can address this problem.
    Moreover, a common problem in finance is that changing distribution of the data
    always poses a threat to the reliability of the model result, but machine learning
    models can adapt themselves to changing patterns in a way that models fit better.
    So there is a huge need and demand for applicable machine learning models in finance,
    and what mainly distinguish this book is the inclusion of brand-new machine learning-based
    modeling approaches in financial risk management.

- en: In a nutshell, this book aims to shift the current landscape of financial risk
    management, which is heavily based on the parametric models. The main motivation
    for this shift is recent developments in highly accurate financial models based
    on machine learning models. Thus, this book is intended for those who have some
    initial knowledge of about finance and machine learning in the sense that I just
    provide brief explanations on these topics.

    what risk is, types of risks (such as market, credit, operational, and liquidity)
    are discussed. Risk management is explained, including why it is important and
    how it can be used to mitigate losses. Asymmetric information, which can address
    the market failures, is also discussed, focusing on information asymmetry and
    adverse selection.

    the moving average model, the autoregressive model, and the autoregressive integrated
    moving average model. We learn how to use an API to access financial data and
    how to employ it. This chapter mainly aims to provide a benchmark for comparing
    the traditional time-series approach with recent developments in time-series modeling,

    in financial markets, which in turn stresses the importance of volatility. Volatility
    is used to measure the degree of risk, which is one of the main engagements of
    the area of finance. This chapter deals with the novel volatility modeling based
    on support vector regression, neural network, deep learning, and the Bayesian
    approach. For the sake of comparison of the performances, traditional ARCH- and
    GARCH-type models are also employed.

    of the traditional market risk models, namely value at risk (VaR) and expected
    shortfall (ES). VaR is a quantitative approach for the potential loss of fair
    value due to market movements that will not be exceeded in a defined period of
    time and with a defined confidence level. ES, on the other hand, focuses on the
    tail of the distribution, referring to big and unexpected losses. A VaR model
    is developed using a denoised covariance matrix, and ES is developed by incorporating
    a liquidity dimension of the data.

    estimation, the Markov chain model, support vector classification, random forests,

    was a lack of source material covering the main financial risk management model
    with machine learning models. This book is an effort to apply the machine learning
    models to financial risk management issues. I came to the conclusion that this
    book should be different from various angles, such as providing both theoretical
    and empirical approaches to the models as well as all the code that makes it possible
    to replicate them. When I shared this idea with Michelle Smith from O’Reilly,
    I got a green light and constant encouragement. Michelle put faith in this project
    and supported me all the way, for which I am very grateful.

    meetings with Michele Cronin, my editor, kept me on track and helped me to gain
    an editorial perspective. As I progressed, each chapter presented new challenges
    that required relentless days and nights to deal with. Well, the more time I spent,
    the harder it became to detect the inaccuracies, typos, and other types of mistakes.
    This is exactly the point where the invaluable feedback of the technical reviewers
    came in. I am grateful to Mehmet Benturk, Hariom Tatsat, Isaac Rhea, Dimitri Bianco,
