- en: Machine learning and deep learning have completely changed the finance industry
    in recent years. The different learning models are well suited to a world where
    data is abundant and continuous. Data is the new gold, and its value keeps rising
    as proper analyses lead to key business decisions, which are the driver of economic
    shifts.

- en: The rise of quantitative funds is living proof that the world of data science
    has much to offer to the trading world. After fundamental and technical traders,
    a new breed of leaders of the universe is emerging. These are the quantitative
    traders who rely on machine-based algorithms with extremely complex operations
    that seek to forecast and outperform the markets.

- en: I have spent my career researching trading strategies, techniques, and all things
    related to the financial world. Through the years, I have become familiar with
    a few algorithmic models that have the potential of adding value to the trading
    framework. In this book, I discuss different learning models and their applications
    in the trading world, with a focus on deep learning and neural networks. My main
    aim is to cover them in such a way that everyone understands how they function.

- en: Machines can perform operations and detection better than humans for many reasons,
    one of which is their objectivity. This means that one of the key skills you will
    learn is how to use Python to create the algorithms required to do such operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned, my objective is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the
    use of deep learning in finance. I do this by discussing a wide range of topics,
    including data science, trading, machine and deep learning models, and reinforcement
    learning applications for trading.

- en: The book begins with an overview of the field of data science and its role in
    the finance world. It then delves into the knowledge requirements, such as statistics,
    math, and Python, before focusing on how to use machine and deep learning in trading
    strategies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for a wide audience, including professionals and academics
    in finance, data scientists, quantitative traders, and students of finance of
    any level. It provides a thorough introduction to the use of machine and deep
    learning in time series prediction, and it is an essential resource for anyone
    who wants to understand and apply these powerful techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book assumes you have basic background knowledge in both Python programming
    (professional Python users will find the code very straightforward) and financial
    trading. I take a clear and simple approach that focuses on the key concepts so
    that you understand the purpose of every idea.
