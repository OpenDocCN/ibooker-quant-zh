<h1><span class="label">Chapter 12. </span>Market Drivers and Risk Management</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html0"/>In today’s rapidly evolving markets, understanding market drivers and risk management is essential for achieving success in trading and investing endeavors.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Market drivers</em> are the factors that influence financial markets, such as economic indicators, corporate performance, geopolitical events, central bank policies, and technological advancements. By understanding these drivers, investors can make informed decisions and anticipate market trends. Algorithmic traders must be aware of these events that may cause turbulence in their models. <em>Risk management</em> is the backbone of a solid investment strategy. It encompasses diversification, stop-loss orders, position sizing, risk-reward assessment, and emotional discipline. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By combining a deep understanding of market drivers with effective risk management techniques, traders can navigate the complexities of financial markets and increase the likelihood of a successful trading algorithm.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This chapter is divided into two main sections. The first section talks about market drivers in a fundamental sense, and the second section discusses risk management from a general point of view.</p>&#13;

<h1>Market Drivers</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Knowledge of market drivers is essential to develop a healthy and sound trading system. Failing to understand what pushes the markets will inevitably cause the demise of the whole process. Up to this point you have seen quantitative trading algorithms that use either lagged values of the same time series or technical indicators, but that’s only a one-dimensional way of seeing things.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">During trading, many events occur that can impact the positions and the risk taken. Knowledge of these events may help mitigate some of the risk, but it may also offer a few directional opportunities along the way. This section can be considered a primer on fundamental analysis and market expectations. If you are familiar with this field, then it should be a breeze.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Market Drivers and Economic Intuition" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="id92">&#13;
<h2>Market Drivers and Economic Intuition</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="economic intuition" data-secondary="market drivers and" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html1"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market drivers" data-secondary="economic intuition and" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html2"/>Market drivers influence and lead the movement and behavior of assets. These drivers can be financial, economic, geopolitical, or even psychological. Consider the following four asset classes: stocks, fixed income, commodities, and currencies.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>As a reminder,<em> fixed income</em> refers to a type of investment that provides investors with regular and predictable payments in the form of interest or dividends over a set period. It is called fixed income because the income generated from these investments is typically fixed and known in advance, as opposed to variable income generated by other investments like stocks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The most common form of fixed income investments is <em>bonds</em>, which are essentially debt securities issued by governments, municipalities, corporations, or other entities to raise capital.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When the economy is strong, it generally has different effects on asset classes due to the varying preferences and behaviors of investors and market participants. Let’s look at them in detail:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Stock market</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stock market" data-secondary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="id823"/>Strong economic conditions often lead to higher corporate profits as businesses experience higher revenues and sales. This boost in earnings can drive stock prices higher, as investors expect better returns from companies. It also results in higher consumer spending. This can benefit companies that rely heavily on consumer purchases, such as retail and consumer goods companies, which may experience increased sales and profitability. Additionally, a strong economy instills confidence in investors, leading them to be more willing to take on risk and invest in the stock market (as opposed to the fixed income market). Positive sentiment can attract more buyers, leading to a rise in stock prices (which may also attract speculative traders who will push prices even higher). It is also possible that central banks may implement policies to effectively control inflation, which can be positive for stocks. Moderate inflation rates and low interest rates can encourage borrowing, investment, and business expansion.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt class="pagebreak-before less_space">Fixed income market</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fixed income market" data-secondary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="id824"/>As the economy strengthens, central banks may increase interest rates to prevent overheating and control inflation. Rising interest rates lead to higher yields on new bonds, making existing bonds with lower yields less attractive. As a result, bond prices may decline, especially for long-term bonds. Additionally, when the economy is strong and businesses are performing well, investors may prefer to allocate more of their funds to the potentially higher returns offered by the stock market rather than fixed income investments. The same reasoning applies to the fact that there will be lower demand for safe haven assets such as government bonds as investors are more confident about the overall economic outlook. Consequently, demand for such bonds may decrease, putting downward pressure on prices.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Commodities</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="commodities" data-secondary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="id825"/>A strong economy typically translates to higher industrial production and increased consumer spending. As a result, the demand for commodities, especially industrial metals like copper and steel, tends to rise due to their use in manufacturing and construction. Economic growth also leads to higher energy consumption. Therefore, oil and natural gas demand often increases, pushing their prices upward. Rising inflation expectations is a result of a growing economy, and this may lead investors to turn to precious metals (such as gold and silver) as a hedge against currency devaluation and market uncertainties. Finally, agricultural commodities (such as wheat and corn) may also witness a rise due to increased consumer spending on food products.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Currencies</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="currency markets" data-secondary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="id826"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FX (foreign exchange) market" data-secondary="market drivers" data-type="indexterm" id="id827"/>A robust economy typically attracts foreign investment and boosts demand for the domestic currency. International investors seek higher returns in a strong economy, leading to increased demand for assets denominated in that currency. As demand for the domestic currency rises, its value appreciates relative to other currencies in the foreign exchange market. Central banks may raise interest rates to manage the rising inflation and ensure economic stability. Higher interest rates attract foreign investors seeking better returns, driving up demand for the domestic currency and pushing its value higher. Similarly, a strong economy often leads to increased exports, as domestic goods and services become more competitive globally. This can improve the country’s trade balance and contribute to a stronger currency.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>These relationships are more complex in real life, as other factors such as political stability and weather events enter into the equation. It is not uncommon to see violations and structural breaks of these correlations and market logic. They may be used as rules of thumb but never as foolproof conditions.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before"><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="economic intuition" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="id828"/>The concept of <em>economic intuition</em> refers to the rationality of selecting features to predict a dependent variable. A basic example of applying economic intuition to predict stock market returns is to select companies’ earnings and treasury yields as independent variables. Economic intuition is recommended when creating sophisticated trading algorithms based on exogenous and fundamental factors.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some experts argue that technical indicators may not be enough to deliver a full picture of what to expect next, but others point to the fact that fundamental measures cannot be used in the short term, and sometimes long-term data is not accessible or sufficient.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html2" data-type="indexterm" id="id829"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html1" data-type="indexterm" id="id830"/></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="News Interpretation" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="id93">&#13;
<h2>News Interpretation</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market drivers" data-secondary="news interpretation" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html3"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="news interpretation" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html4"/><em>News interpretation</em> is the process of analyzing and understanding how news events, economic indicators, geopolitical developments, and other relevant information impacts financial markets. Before exploring how to analyze news, it is important to refresh your knowledge of economic indicators:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
 <dt>Gross domestic product (GDP)</dt>&#13;
 <dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GDP (gross domestic product)" data-type="indexterm" id="id831"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="gross domestic product (GDP)" data-type="indexterm" id="id832"/>This measure represents the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders during a specific period, typically measured on a quarterly or annual basis. GDP is used as a measure of the overall economic health and performance of a nation.</p></dd>&#13;
 &#13;
 <dt>Unemployment rate</dt>&#13;
 <dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="unemployment rate" data-type="indexterm" id="id833"/>This measure calculates the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. It is a key metric used to assess the health of the job market and overall economic conditions. The unemployment rate is typically reported on a monthly basis by government agencies. A lower unemployment rate is generally considered positive as it indicates a healthier job market, higher economic activity, and more opportunities for job seekers. Conversely, a higher unemployment rate can be a sign of economic challenges and underutilization of the labor force. Policymakers closely monitor the unemployment rate to gauge the effectiveness of their economic policies and make informed decisions to address employment-related issues.</p></dd>&#13;
 &#13;
 <dt>Inflation rate</dt>&#13;
 <dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="inflation rate" data-type="indexterm" id="id834"/>Simply put, inflation is the overall increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did previously. In other words, inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. Inflation is commonly measured using various price indices, such as the consumer price index (CPI). It is typically calculated on a year-on-year basis. You saw the CPI in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p></dd>&#13;
 &#13;
 <dt>Central bank policy rates</dt>&#13;
 <dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="benchmark rates" data-type="indexterm" id="id835"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="central bank policy rates" data-type="indexterm" id="id836"/>Also known as <em>benchmark rates</em>, they represent the interest rates set by a country’s central bank to influence and control the overall economic activity and inflation within the country. These rates serve as a primary tool of the monetary policy. The most common central bank policy rate is the <em>overnight </em>or <em>policy</em> rate, which is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow or lend money to the central bank on an overnight basis. This rate is crucial because it influences various other interest rates in the economy, including those charged on loans and earned on savings accounts. Central banks use changes in policy rates to achieve specific economic objectives, such as controlling inflation, stimulating growth, and maintaining price stability.</p></dd>&#13;
 &#13;
 <dt>Consumer confidence indices</dt>&#13;
 <dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="consumer confidence indices" data-type="indexterm" id="id837"/>These indices measure the level of optimism or pessimism among consumers regarding their current and future economic prospects. These indices are designed to gauge consumer sentiment, which can provide insights into consumer spending behavior and overall economic health. Consumer confidence indices are usually based on surveys conducted among a representative sample of households.</p></dd>&#13;
 &#13;

&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Another important economic indicator is the ISM PMI, an <span class="keep-together">indicator</span> discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As a trader, news interpretation involves assessing the significance of news items and determining their potential effects on asset prices. Consider the following points when consuming news:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>Different news items can affect various asset classes differently. For instance, positive economic data might boost stocks but lead to a decline in safe-haven assets like gold. Understanding the correlations and inverse relationships between news events and assets is crucial.</li>&#13;
	<li>News can shape market sentiment, leading to either bullish or bearish trends. Traders must gauge how news is perceived by market participants and how it may influence their behavior.</li>&#13;
	<li class="fix_tracking">Some news has an immediate impact on markets, causing sudden price movements, while other news may have a more gradual and prolonged effect. Traders should be aware of the time sensitivity of news to optimize their trading strategies.</li>&#13;
	<li>In some cases, the market has already priced in expectations of certain news events. Traders need to compare the actual news release with market expectations to determine whether the news is a surprise or not.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Staying informed through reputable financial news outlets (such as the <em>Financial Times</em> and Bloomberg) and conducting thorough research can help traders make better-informed decisions in a dynamic and ever-changing market environment<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html4" data-type="indexterm" id="id838"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="id839"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html0" data-type="indexterm" id="id840"/></p>&#13;

<h1>Risk Management</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html5"/>Finding a predictive and profitable trading strategy is what will make you money, but a sound risk management system is what will allow you to keep it. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="diversification" data-type="indexterm" id="id841"/>In traditional finance, the most basic form of risk management is <em>diversification</em>, which means to allocate your funds into different uncorrelated asset classes so that you spread out the risk of capital depreciation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another example of basic risk management is simply the avoidance of scams that may plague the retail trading community every now and then.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Nowadays, there is a huge number of asset managers, signal providers, and copytrading algorithms that promise high and consistent returns. The abundance of these online services begs the question as to whether the quality of the investment is worth it or not. There are three simple rules to follow when you assess a trading service:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li><em>Guaranteed returns</em> and <em>scam </em>are two interchangeable concepts. Avoid falling into this trap.</li>&#13;
	<li>Even the slightest vagueness in a track record is a major red flag. Ask for transparent and interpretable results backed by third-party auditors.</li>&#13;
	<li>The overwhelming majority of track records are fake, and the results are mostly based on faulty backtests or selection bias. You have to always be skeptical.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)" data-type="indexterm" id="id842"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)" data-type="indexterm" id="id843"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="id844"/>Another example of risk management is position sizing. <em>Position sizing</em> refers to the process of determining the appropriate amount of capital to allocate to a particular trade or investment. It involves calculating the number of shares, contracts, or lots to trade based on various factors such as risk tolerance, account size, and market conditions. Proper position sizing is crucial for risk management and helps traders avoid excessive losses. Smart trading algorithms have this functionality embedded in them when they trade so that the positions are optimized based on a number of factors such as volatility and expected return.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">There are several techniques and methods for position sizing, such as the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt><em>Fixed monetary amount</em></dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This method involves allocating a fixed monetary amount of your trading capital to each trade. For example, you may decide to risk $250 of your account on each trade. This approach therefore assumes equal weights for every trade.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt><em>Fixed fractional</em></dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>With this technique, you allocate a fixed fraction of your trading capital to each trade. For instance, you may decide to risk 1% of your account on each trade. As your account size changes, the position size adjusts accordingly.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt><em>Kelly criterion</em></dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>The Kelly criterion is a mathematical formula that calculates the optimal position size based on the probability of winning and losing trades. It takes into account the trader’s edge (probability of success) and the payoff ratio. The formula helps determine the percentage of capital to allocate to maximize long-term growth while minimizing the risk of ruin.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Hit ratio method</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>The hit ratio method is a technique I use that takes a momentum approach with regard to winning and losing streaks. It assumes that winning must be rewarded with bigger positions while losing must be penalized with smaller positions. The better the hit ratio, the bigger the positions get and vice versa.</p></dd>&#13;

<h2>Basics of Risk Management</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="basics" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html6"/>Risk management does not have to be complex. You can create a solid risk management system by using the few simple techniques given in this section.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Stops and targets" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="id95">&#13;
<h3>Stops and targets</h3>&#13;

<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="stops and targets" data-type="indexterm" id="id845"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stop-loss order" data-type="indexterm" id="id846"/>A <em>stop-loss order</em> (stop) is an automatic order set during trade initiation to ensure a minimal predetermined loss. For example, if you buy a few contracts on gold at $1,500 in anticipation that it will go to $2,000, you may place your stop-loss order at $1,250 so that if the price drops to $1,250, you limit your losses to no more than $250. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="take-profit order (target)" data-type="indexterm" id="id847"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="target (take-profit order)" data-type="indexterm" id="id848"/>At the same time, your anticipation of selling when the market price reaches $2,000 is known as a <em>take-profit order</em> (<em>target</em>).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>The most basic risk management system for any trade is setting proper stops and targets so that you are framing your expectations and limiting your risks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There is one rule that you must never violate: always place stops and <span class="keep-together">targets</span>. Algorithms easily allow you to automate this process.</p>&#13;

</div></section>&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Trailing stops" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="id102">&#13;
<h3>Trailing stops</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="trailing stops" data-type="indexterm" id="id849"/>A <em>trailing stop</em> is a dynamic stop-loss order that follows the market price whenever it goes in the expected direction, thus ensuring less loss and at some point in time ensuring a no-loss trade. The best way to understand the trailing stop order is through an example.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Suppose you go long on EURUSD at $1.0000 to target $1.0500. You set your stop-loss order at $0.9900 to limit your losses. Now suppose two days have passed and the current market price is at $1.0230, and you want to ensure that your trade never loses money. The solution to this is a trailing stop order where you move your stop from $0.9900 to $1.0000 so that, in the worst-case scenario, when the market drops back to $1.0000 you close out and break even.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another way of ensuring at least some profit is to move the stop to $1.0100, thus ensuring a profitable trade no matter what. Of course, the closer you move your stop to the current market price, the more likely you are to be stopped out at a profit.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>It is always a good idea to use trailing stops with trend-following strategies as they allow you to ride the trend.</p>&#13;

<p>Some traders trade based on the news, and therefore they like to trade ahead of news releases or seconds after them to profit from volatility. Risk management-wise, this is not recommended, as fluctuations are random around news events, which can surprise the markets from time to time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The best thing to do is to avoid trading around the times of an important release that has historically caused some extreme variations. Examples may include political announcements, GDP numbers, and FOMC meetings.</p>&#13;

By having a deep understanding of behavioral finance, you will better understand why the market reacts the way it does, especially around certain events and levels.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Financial markets are composed of the actions and reactions of different human and robotic participants, which makes for a psychological and quantitative stew. This explains the low signal-to-noise ratio—in other words, why it is difficult to accurately forecast the market on a regular basis. These actions and reactions are also referred to as <em>biases</em>, and they are human shortcomings in response to certain events. Biases are the main protagonists of this section, and they are divided into two <span class="keep-together">categories</span>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Cognitive biases</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>These biases come from a lack of knowledge. Cognitive biases generally involve incorrect conclusions based on wrong market assumptions or bad research.</p></dd>&#13;

<h3>Cognitive biases</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="behavioral finance" data-secondary="cognitive biases" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html10"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="bias" data-secondary="cognitive" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html11"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cognitive biases" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_12.html12"/>This subsection lists some of the most common cognitive biases and their market impact and offers recommendations on how to avoid them:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Conservatism bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="confirmation bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id853"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="conservatism bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id854"/>This occurs when a market participant is slow to react to new information and places too much weight on base rates. It is a type of failure to adapt. The way to deal with this bias is to force yourself to be skeptical of the basic analysis and to always be dynamic and ready for change. The market does not always behave as it did in the past since it is forward looking.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Confirmation bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This occurs when the trader focuses on the type of information that benefits their ongoing position and dismisses the type of information that is not favorable to their position. This is by far one of the most common biases and is actually a normal state of mind that leads to overconfidence over time. The best way to remedy this is to remain impartial and neutral, which is easier said than done. Another way is to automate the decision-making process through scorecards highlighting the attractiveness (or not) of the analyzed underlying assets. Humans in general suffer from this bias—it is not just finance specific.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Illusion of control bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="illusion of control bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id855"/>This occurs when the trader overestimates their ability to control the trade outcome. Mainly caused by a streak of winning trades, this bias can lead to concentrated positions due to a sense of power over the invested asset. Markets are composed of a huge number of participants with trillions of invested dollars and as such are unlikely to be impacted by any single person (there are a few, very rare exceptions involving small and illiquid assets). The way to remove the <span class="keep-together">illusion</span> of control is to stay focused and humble and understand that you are facing a semirandom environment that changes its dynamics and drivers every day.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Hindsight bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hindsight bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id856"/>This occurs when a trader overestimates their past accuracy and can lead to excessive risk taking. It is easy to look at past charts and conclude that the subsequent direction was obvious. Most backtests include a form of hindsight bias since conditions were created at the end of the analyzed period. Market technicians overestimate their abilities when they see that some techniques worked well in the past but fail to take into account the environment of the tested period. Also, some configurations do not look the same when they’re happening as when they are complete. Hindsight bias can be hard to cure, but the best way is to take into consideration the variables that were present during the analyzed period to simulate the past environment in a more realistic way.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Anchoring bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="anchoring bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id857"/>This occurs when the trader’s opinion is anchored to a certain base point and fails to change to incorporate new information. As I have mentioned, the analyst or trader must maintain a dynamic and open mindset. The best way to cure this bias is to stay up to date with regard to new information and pieces of data.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Availability bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="availability bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id858"/>This occurs when the trader selects positions based on how easily they can retrieve memories of them. This means that familiar assets are more attractive than nonfamiliar assets, which is a wrong assumption as opportunities may come from any type of market. It is a type of mental shortcut where the trader does not expend much effort in research. To cure this bias, you must practice full due diligence before selecting a universe of investable assets. Do not just trade the EURUSD because you are familiar with it: expand your horizons.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Loss aversion bias<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.html#id859" id="id859-marker">1</a></sup></dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="loss aversion bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id860"/>This occurs when the pain of losing is greater than the joy of winning. It is by far the most common bias. Humans are known to prefer not to lose money than to gain money, as was demonstrated in “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Making Under Risk” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1977). Loss <span class="keep-together">aversion</span> could lead to decreased risk taking and therefore decreased expected return. However, the most significant effect is on the stop levels. Loss-averse humans do not want to accept that they are losing money and will see a losing position as an ongoing position and, therefore, prefer to wait until it turns positive. This is highly dangerous, as leaving positions without stop-loss levels could lead to disastrous results. In addition, some people close out of winning positions too quickly in fear that they will turn negative (a form of fear of regret). The best way to handle loss aversion is to automate the risk management process and to respect the stop-loss and target orders established at the initiation of the trade.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html12" data-type="indexterm" id="id861"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html11" data-type="indexterm" id="id862"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html10" data-type="indexterm" id="id863"/></p></dd>&#13;

<h3>Emotional biases</h3>&#13;
&#13;

As a reminder, while cognitive biases are related to a lack of knowledge, emotional biases are related to psychological traits:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Overconfidence bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="overconfidence bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id866"/>This occurs when a trader enjoys a winning streak and believes it is due to their superior ability to trade the markets, which leads to holding concentrated positions and excessive trading. A good streak will come to an end, and thus the trader must always follow procedures and ensure that they do not stray from the strategy.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Regret-aversion bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regret-aversion bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id867"/>This refers to staying in low-risk investments out of fear. This really is all about the risk profile of the trader. There is no right or wrong answer, but the fear of regret can make the trader lose out on interesting opportunities. You should take risks to make money, but only calculated risks.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Endowment bias</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="endowment bias" data-type="indexterm" id="id868"/>This occurs when the trader believes that the owned assets are more valuable than the ones that are not owned. This may hamper the trader’s opportunities and cause them to be limited to the assets they already own, even if they decay over time. The market has opportunities everywhere, and participants must always be on the lookout for the next big thing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html9" data-type="indexterm" id="id869"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html8" data-type="indexterm" id="id870"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html7" data-type="indexterm" id="id871"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_12.html5" data-type="indexterm" id="id872"/></p></dd>&#13;
