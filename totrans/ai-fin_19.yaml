    This is the main question that this final chapter discusses. It starts with [“Notions
    and Definitions”](#notions_definitions), which defines expressions such as *financial
    singularity* and *artificial financial intelligence* (AFI). [“What Is at Stake?”](#at_stake)
    illustrates what, in terms of potential wealth accumulation, is at stake in the
    race for an AFI. [“Paths to Financial Singularity”](#paths_to_fs) considers, against
    the background of [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#superintelligence), paths that might
    lead to an AFI. [“Orthogonal Skills and Resources”](#orthogonality) argues that
    there are a number of resources that are instrumental and orthogonal to the goal
    of creating an AFI. Anybody involved in the race for an AFI will compete for these
    resources. Finally, [“Star Trek or Star Wars”](#star_trek_wars) considers whether
    an AFI, as discussed in this chapter, will benefit only a few people or humanity
    as a whole.

    and super-institutional levels, as well as with unprecedented accuracy*. In that
    sense, such a trading bot would be characterized as an artificial narrow intelligence

    human being or any other agent in playing the game of Go. Therefore, even if it
    is not yet clear whether there will ever be an AI agent that qualifies as an AGI

    experience with AI applied to finance. However, not all players in the financial
    industry are positioned equally well to arrive at a trading AFI first. Some, like
    banks, are rather restricted by regulatory requirements. Others simply follow
    different business models, such as exchanges. Others, like certain assets managers,

    mostly compete against each other, with “non-AFI” players being sidelined. The
    sponsors of the single projects would strive to gain advantages, however small,

    the start. In such a scenario, a single AFI emerges and is able to quickly reach
    a level of dominance in financial trading that cannot be matched by any other
    competitor. This could be for several reasons. One reason might be that the first
    AFI generates returns so impressive that the assets under management swell at
    a tremendous pace, leading to ever higher budgets that in turn allows it to acquire
    ever more relevant resources. Another reason might be that the first AFI quickly
    reaches a size at which its actions can have a market impact—with the ability
    to manipulate market prices, for instance—such that it becomes the major, or even
    the only, driving force in financial markets.

    potentially serve humanity. Unfortunately, it is to be assumed that only the sponsors
    of the project leading to an AFI will directly benefit from the type of AFI imagined
    in this chapter. This is because such an AFI would only generate profits by trading
    in the financial markets and not by inventing new products, solving important
    problems, or growing businesses and industries. In other words, an AFI that merely
    trades in the financial markets to generate profits is taking part in a zero-sum
    game and does not directly increase the distributable wealth.

    only benefit a certain group and not humanity as a whole. It would also be in
    question whether the sponsors of a successful AFI project would be willing to
    open up to outside investors. A good example in this regard is the Medallion fund,
    managed by Renaissance Technologies and one of the best-performing investment
    vehicles in history. Renaissance closed Medallion, which is essentially run exclusively
    by machines, to outside investors in 1993\. Its stellar performance for sure would
    have attracted large amounts of additional assets. However, specific considerations,
    such as the capacity of certain strategies, play a role in this context, and similar
    considerations might also apply to an AFI.

    problems faced by humanity as a whole—serious diseases, environmental problems,
    unknown threats from outer space, and so forth—an AFI more probably leads to more
    inequality and fiercer competition in the markets. Instead of a *Star Trek*–like
    world, characterized by equality and inexhaustible resources, it cannot be excluded
    that an AFI might rather lead to a *Star Wars*–like world, characterized by intensive
    trade wars and fights over available resources. At the time of this writing, global
    trade wars, such as the one between the US and China, seem more intense than ever,
    and technology and AI are important battlegrounds.

    many of the capabilities and characteristics of a superintelligence. An AFI could
    rather be compared to AlphaZero, which is an ANI for playing board games such

    Of course, in financial trading, a lot more is at stake compared to playing board
    games.

    projects have progressed already, there are a number of instrumental resources
