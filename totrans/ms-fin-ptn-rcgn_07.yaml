    is generally used to refer to people who look exactly the same but are biologically
    unrelated. The Doppelgänger candlestick pattern is a three-candlestick reversal
    configuration that I like to use to confirm intermediate reversals.

    balance. With similar candles, hesitation looms around the current aggregate direction,
    which may cause a complete shift of regime. Also, the equality of the lows (in
    a bullish Doppelgänger) and the highs (in a bearish Doppelgänger) is equivalent
    to the concept of support and resistance levels, respectively.

- en: The reason there are differences between the theory and the real application
    of candlestick patterns is that the theory deals with the intuition but does not
    guarantee the minimum required frequency of patterns detected. In real life, you
    have to adapt some conditions while retaining the intuition of the pattern.

- en: To summarize, the Mirror pattern assumes a U-turn movement where market participants
    gradually change course. It is a rare pattern, as the conditions to achieve it
    may be tedious, but the intuition of the pattern is clear. The Mirror pattern
    can also be considered a continuation of the Doppelgänger pattern.

    pattern. I have added some flexibility, which omits the theoretical condition
    that assumes similar lows for the three middle candles (bullish configuration)
    and similar highs (bearish configuration), as shown in Figures [7-21](#figure7-21)
    and [7-22](#figure7-22) through the dotted horizontal line.

    carefulness, which is manifested through the Shrinking candlesticks before a big
    candlestick breaks out of the congestion and confirms a new direction.
