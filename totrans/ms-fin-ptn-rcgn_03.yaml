    history to determine the likely aggregate direction of the market. It relies on
    the idea that the past is the best predictor of the future. There are several
    types of techniques within the vast field that is technical analysis, notably

    A *pattern* is generally an event that emerges from time to time and presents
    a certain theoretical or empirical outcome. In finance, it is more complicated,
    but certain patterns have been shown to add value across time, and this may partly
    be due to a phenomenon called *self-fulfilling prophecy* (a process by which an
    initial expectation leads to its confirmation). Among known patterns are candlestick
    patterns, which are the protagonists of this book.

    but what does that mean? *Market efficiency* states that information is already
    embedded in the current price and that price and value are the same thing. When
    you buy an asset, you are hoping that it is *undervalued* (in fundamental analysis
    jargon) or *oversold* (in technical analysis jargon), which is why you believe
    the price should go up to meet the value. Therefore, you are assuming that the
    value is greater than the price. Market efficiency rebuffs any claims that the
    price does not equal the value and therefore suggests that any alpha trading must
    not result in above average returns (*alpha trading* is the act of engaging in
    speculative operations to perform better than a benchmark, which is typically
    an index or a weighted measure).

    as one of its principles is that in the weak form of efficiency, you cannot earn

    bullish pressure to increase your probability of a winning trade. Similarly, in
    the case of a descending channel, focus more on short selling whenever the market
    reaches the upper limit. The full version of Zweig’s axiom goes as follows: “The
    trend is your friend, until the end when it bends.” This means that at any point
    in time, the market may change its regime, and any friendship with the trend gets
    terminated. In the end, charting analysis is subjective in nature and relies more

    back-test using unbiased algorithms. Only then can you know for sure if the pattern
    adds value or not. Many retail traders fall into the trap of taking a general
    and simplistic look at the past to determine the validity of their strategies,

    horizon. An example of this is to look for opportunities on the hourly chart while
    disregarding the market’s configuration on the daily chart. It is a strict rule
    to know that the longer time frame (weekly and monthly) is always more important
    than the shorter time frame, meaning that if you have a solid resistance on the
    higher time frame, you should not really look to buy close to that level even
    if you see a bullish configuration on the shorter time frame.
