    much as they have in the last eight years. It is a natural temptation to expect
    that the next decade has to contain less change. However, we believe that the
    opposite will likely be true.

    because long-standing risk management practice cannot keep pace with recent developments
    or be a precursor to unfolding crises. Therefore, it is important to monitor and
    adopt the changes brought by structural breaks in a risk management process. Adopting
    these changes implies redefining the components and tools of risk management,
    and that is what this book is all about.

    inference. Econometrics has been built on the rationale of statistical inference.
    These types of models concentrate on the structure of underlying data, generating
    process and relationships among variables. Machine learning (ML) models, however,
    are not assumed to define the underlying data-generating processes but are considered
    as a means to an end for the purpose of prediction (Lommers, El Harzli, and Kim
    2021). Thus, ML models tend to be more data centric and prediction accuracy oriented.

    and it is not hard to guess that the econometric models cannot perform well in
    those cases. Given the solution that ML models provide to data unavailability
    via synthetic data generation, these models have been on the top of the agenda
    in finance, and financial risk management is, of course, no exception.

    than knowing this due to its abstract nature. Risk is perceived as something hazardous,

    risk may require sacrificing return, and it can be tolerable up to certain level

    risk management paved the way for this breakdown in the financial system. To understand
    this breakdown, we need to dig into past financial risk management failures. A

    Russia. The Russian debt default deeply affected LTCM‚Äôs portfolio due to *flight

    both curves are downward sloping, implying that as more people demand contracts
    and more people are added on the contracts, the risk lowers, affecting the price
    of the contract.'

    and the other line, showing a step-wise downward slope, denotes the demand for
    insurance contracts. As we start analysis with the risky customers, as you add
    more and more people to the contract, the level of riskiness diminishes in parallel
    with the average cost.

    one party of the contract assumes more risk than the other party. Formally, *moral
    hazard* may be defined as a situation in which the more informed party takes advantages
    of the private information at their disposal to the detriment of others.

- en: 'For a better understanding of moral hazard, a simple example can be given from
    the credit market: suppose that entity A demands credit for use in financing the
    project that is considered feasible to finance. Moral hazard arises if entity
    A uses the loan for the payment of credit debt to bank C, without prior notice
    to the lender bank. While allocating credit, the moral hazard situation that banks
    may encounter arises as a result of asymmetric information, decreases banks‚Äô lending
    appetites, and appears as one of the reasons why banks put so much labor into
    the credit allocation process.'

    of the main pillars of financial analysis in the sense that most financial data
    has a time dimension, which requires special attention and techniques to deal
