<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="AI in finance" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ai_finance_pref"/>AI and ML reflect the natural evolution&#13;
of technology as increased computing power enables computers to sort through large data sets and crunch numbers to identify patterns and outliers.</p>&#13;
<p data-type="attribution">BlackRock (2019)</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="financial modeling" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_fin_model_pref"/>Financial modeling has a long history with many successfully accomplished tasks, but at the same time it has been fiercely criticized due mainly to lack of <em>flexibility</em> and <em>non-inclusiveness</em> of the models. The 2007–2008 financial crisis fueled this debate as well as paved the way for innovations and different approaches in the field of financial modeling.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Of course, the financial crisis was not the only thing precipitating the growth of AI applications in finance. Two other drivers, data availability and increased computing power, have spurred the adoption of AI in finance and have intensified research in this area starting in the 1990s.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Financial Stability Board (2017) stresses the validity of this fact:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Many applications, or use “cases,” of AI and machine learning already exist. The adoption of these use cases has been driven by both supply factors, such as technological advances and the availability of financial sector data and infrastructure, and by demand factors, such as profitability needs, competition with other firms, and the demands of financial regulation.</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As a subbranch of financial modeling, financial risk management has been evolving with the adoption of AI in parallel with its ever-growing role in the financial decision-making process. In his celebrated book, Bostrom (2014) denotes that there are two important revolutions in the history of mankind: the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. These two revolutions have had such a profound impact that any third revolution of similar magnitude would double the size of the world economy in two weeks. Even more strikingly, if the third revolution were accomplished by AI, the impact would be way more profound.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So expectations are sky-high for AI applications shaping financial risk management at an unprecedented scale by making use of big data and understanding the complex structure of risk processes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With this study, I aim to fill the void about machine learning-based applications in finance so that predictive and measurement performance of financial models can be improved. <a data-primary="parametric modeling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45737259114944"/>Parametric models suffer from issues of low variance and high bias; machine learning models, with their flexibility, can address this problem. Moreover, a common problem in finance is that changing distribution of the data always poses a threat to the reliability of the model result, but machine learning models can adapt themselves to changing patterns in a way that models fit better. So there is a huge need and demand for applicable machine learning models in finance, and what mainly distinguish this book is the inclusion of brand-new machine learning-based modeling approaches in financial risk management.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In a nutshell, this book aims to shift the current landscape of financial risk management, which is heavily based on the parametric models. The main motivation for this shift is&#13;
recent developments&#13;
in highly accurate financial models based on machine learning models. Thus, this book is intended for those who have some initial knowledge of about finance and machine learning in the sense that I just provide brief explanations on these topics.<a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_ai_finance_pref" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45737259105104"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_model_pref" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45737259068976"/></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Consequently, the targeted audience of the book includes, but is not limited to, financial risk analysts, financial engineers, risk associates, risk modelers, model validators, quant risk analysts, portfolio analysis, and those who are interested in finance and data science.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In light of the background of the targeted audience, having an introductory level of finance and data science knowledge will enable you to benefit most from the book. It does not, however, mean that people from different backgrounds cannot follow the book topics. Rather, readers from different backgrounds can grasp the concepts as long as they spend enough time and refer to some other finance and data science books along with this one.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The book consists of 10 chapters:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#chapter_1">Chapter 1, “Fundamentals of Risk Management”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter introduces the main concepts of risk management.  After defining what risk is, types of risks (such as market, credit, operational, and liquidity) are discussed. Risk management is explained, including why it is important and how it can be used to mitigate losses. Asymmetric information, which can address the market failures, is also discussed, focusing on information asymmetry and adverse selection.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.html#chapter_2">Chapter 2, “Introduction to Time Series Modeling”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter shows the time-series applications using traditional models, namely the moving average model, the autoregressive model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model. We learn how to use an API to access financial data and how to employ it. This chapter mainly aims to provide a benchmark for comparing the traditional time-series approach with recent developments in time-series modeling, which is the main focus of the next chapter.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.html#chapter_3">Chapter 3, “Deep Learning for Time Series Modeling”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter introduces the deep learning tools for time-series modeling. Recurrent neural network and long short-term memory are two approaches by which we are able to model the data with time dimension. This chapter also gives an impression of the applicability of deep learning models to time-series modeling.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.html#chapter_4">Chapter 4, “Machine Learning-Based &#13;
<span class="keep-together">Volatility Prediction</span>”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Increased integration of financial markets has led to a prolonged uncertainty in financial markets, which in turn stresses the importance of volatility. Volatility is used to measure the degree of risk, which is one of the main engagements of the area of finance. This chapter deals with the novel volatility modeling based on support vector regression, neural network, deep learning, and the Bayesian approach. For the sake of comparison of the performances, traditional ARCH- and GARCH-type models are also employed.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.html#chapter_5">Chapter 5, “Modeling Market Risk”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Here, machine learning-based models are employed to boost estimation performance of the traditional market risk models, namely value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). VaR is a quantitative approach for the potential loss of fair value due to market movements that will not be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level. ES, on the other hand, focuses on the tail of the distribution, referring to big and unexpected losses. A VaR model is developed using a denoised covariance matrix, and ES is developed by incorporating a liquidity dimension of the data.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.html#chapter_6">Chapter 6, “Credit Risk Estimation”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter introduces a comprehensive machine learning–based approach to estimating credit risk. Machine learning models are applied based on past credit information along with other data. The approach starts with risk bucketing, which is suggested by the Basel Accord, and continues with different models: Bayesian estimation, the Markov chain model, support vector classification, random forests, neural networks, and deep learning. In the last part of the chapter, the performance of these models will be compared.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.html#chapter_7">Chapter 7, “Liquidity Modeling”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, Gaussian mixture model is used to model the liquidity, which is thought to be a neglected dimension in risk management. This model allows us to incorporate different aspects of the liquidity proxies so that we can capture the effect of liquidity on financial risk in a more robust way.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#chapter_8">Chapter 8, “Modeling Operational Risk”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter covers the operational risk that may result in a failure, mostly due to a company’s internal weakness.&#13;
There are several sources of operational risks, but fraud risk is one of the most time-consuming and detrimental to the company’s operations. Here, fraud will be our main focus, and new approaches will be developed to have better-performing fraud applications based on machine learning models.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.html#chapter_9">Chapter 9, “A Corporate Governance Risk Measure: Stock Price Crash”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter introduces a brand-new approach to modeling corporate governance risk: stock price crash. Many studies find an empirical link between stock price crash and corporate governance. Using the minimum covariance determinant model, this chapter attempts to unveil the relationship between the components of corporate governance risk and stock price crash.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.html#chapter_10">Chapter 10, “Synthetic Data Generation and &#13;
<span class="keep-together">The Hidden Markov Model in Finance</span>”</a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Here we use synthetic data to estimate different financial risks. The aim of this chapter is to highlight the emergence of synthetic data, which helps us to minimize the impact of limited historical data. Synthetic data allows us to have data that is large enough and of high quality, which then improves the quality of the model.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The decision to write this book did not come out of the blue. I felt that there was a lack of source material covering the main financial risk management model with machine learning models. This book is an effort to apply the machine learning models to financial risk management issues. I came to the conclusion that this book should be different from various angles, such as providing both theoretical and empirical approaches to the models as well as all the code that makes it possible to replicate them. When I shared this idea with Michelle Smith from O’Reilly, I got a green light and constant encouragement. Michelle put faith in this project and supported me all the way,&#13;
for which I am very grateful.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As soon as new chapters of the book came in, the informative and fun weekly meetings with Michele Cronin, my editor, kept me on track and helped me to gain an editorial perspective. As I progressed, each chapter presented new challenges that required relentless days and nights to deal with. Well, the more time I spent, the harder it became to detect the inaccuracies, typos, and other types of mistakes. This is exactly the point where the invaluable feedback of the technical reviewers came in. I am grateful to Mehmet Benturk, Hariom Tatsat, Isaac Rhea, Dimitri Bianco, McKlayne Marshall, and Michael Shearer for their efforts in making the book what it is today.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, I would like to thank Danny Elfanbaum and Randy Balaban for their quick and helpful comments on the consistency of text. After a long, roller-coaster year, I came to the end of this tedious yet enlightening milestone of my life full of hope that this book will shed light on the path of those who want to learn machine learning in finance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I want to convey my deepest gratitude to those who contributed to the book.</p>&#13;
