    followed the chapters diligently, you have already encountered many important
    ideas and concepts in both financial theory and Python programming. That is great.
    The topics covered in this book, both with regard to breadth and depth, represent
    good starting points for exploring the exciting and fast-changing world of computational
    finance. However, there is much more to explore and learn. This final chapter
    provides suggestions for moving on and going deeper in one or several directions
    in Python for finance.

    from linear algebra, probability theory, and optimization theory. The tools and
    techniques applied to financial problems are fairly standard and do not require
    advanced mathematical skills to be put to beneficial use with Python. However,
    modern finance can be considered an *applied mathematics discipline*, with some
    areas relying heavily on advanced mathematics—such as option pricing or financial
    risk management.

    some of the most important and popular financial models, such as the mean-variance
    portfolio theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and the Black-Scholes-Merton
    option pricing model. More generally speaking, it covers simple and more realistic
    static model economies (with two points in time only) as well as dynamic model
    economies to allow for uncertainty to resolve gradually over time. There are whole
    areas in mathematical finance that are not covered, however, such as continuous
    time models for option pricing that require additional, more advanced mathematical
    tools. The book also does not discuss, for example, such important financial topics
    as the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).

    of oftentimes complex numerical computations and simulations is of the essence—in

    pure Python might indeed be too slow to implement, say, computationally demanding
    simulation algorithms, packages such as `NumPy` and `pandas` allow much faster
    execution times when used appropriately. Such packages provide high-level programming
    APIs to functionality that is implemented in performant C code in general. This
