- en: Generative AI, and Chat GPT-4 in particular, is all the rage these days. Probabilistic
    machine learning (ML) is a type of generative AI that is ideally suited for finance
    and investing. Unlike deep neural networks, on which ChatGPT is based, probabilistic
    ML models are not black boxes. These models also enable you to infer causes from
    effects in a fairly transparent manner. This is important in heavily regulated
    industries, such as finance and healthcare, where you have to explain the basis
    of your decisions to many stakeholders.

- en: Probabilistic ML also enables you to explicitly and systematically encode personal,
    empirical, and institutional knowledge into ML models to sustain your organization’s
    competitive advantages. What truly distinguishes probabilistic ML from its conventional
    counterparts is its capability of seamlessly simulating new data and counterfactual
    knowledge conditioned on the observed data and model assumptions on which it was
    trained and tested, regardless of the size of the dataset or the ordering of the
    data. Probabilistic models are generative models that know their limitations and
    honestly express their ignorance by widening the ranges of their inferences and
    predictions. You won’t get such quantified doubts from ChatGPT’s confident hallucinations,
    more commonly known as fibs and lies.

- en: All ML models are built on the assumption that patterns discovered in training
    or in-sample data will persist in testing or out-of-sample data. However, when
    nonprobabilistic ML models encounter patterns in data that they have never been
    trained or tested on, they make egregious inferences and predictions because of
    the inherent foundational flaws of their statistical models. Furthermore, these
    ML models do it with complete confidence and without warning decision makers of
    their uncertainties.

- en: The increasing adoption of nonprobabilistic ML models for decision making in
    finance and investments can lead to catastrophic consequences for individuals
    and society at large, including bankruptcies and economic recessions. It is imperative
    that all ML models quantify the uncertainty of their inferences and predictions
    on unseen data to support sound decision making in a complex world with three-dimensional
    uncertainties. Leading companies clearly understand the limitations of standard
    AI technologies and are developing their probabilistic versions to extend their
    applicability to more complex problems. Google recently introduced TensorFlow
    Probability to extend its established TensorFlow platform. Similarly, Facebook
    and Uber have introduced Pyro to extend their PyTorch platforms. Currently, the
    most popular open source probabilistic ML technologies are PyMC and Stan. PyMC
    is written in Python, and Stan is written in C++. This book uses the extensive
    ecosystem of user-friendly Python libraries.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary audience of this book is the thinking practitioner in the finance
    and investing discipline. A thinking practitioner is someone who doesn’t merely
    want to follow instructions from a manual or cookbook. They want to understand
    the underlying concepts for why they must adopt a process, model, or technology.
    Generally, they are intellectually curious and enjoy learning for its own sake.
    At the same time, they are not looking for onerous mathematical proofs or tedious
    academic tomes. I have provided many scholarly references in each chapter for
    readers who are looking for the mathematical and technical details underlying
    the concepts and reasoning presented in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A thinking practitioner could be an individual investor, analyst, developer,
    manager, project manager, data scientist, researcher, portfolio manager, or quantitative
    trader. These thinking practitioners understand that they need to learn new concepts
    and technologies continually to advance their careers and businesses. A practical
    depth of understanding gives them the confidence to apply what they learn to develop
    creative solutions for their unique challenges. It also gives them a framework
    to explore and learn related technologies and concepts more easily.

- en: In this book, I am assuming that readers have a basic familiarity with finance,
    statistics, machine learning, and Python. I am not assuming that they have read
    any particular book or mastered any particular skill. I am only assuming that
    they have a willingness to learn, especially when ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing AI can
    easily explain any code or formula in this book.

- en: Why I Wrote This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a paucity of general probabilistic ML books, and none that is dedicated
    entirely to finance and investing problems. Because of the idiosyncratic complexities
    of these domains, any naive application of ML in general and probabilistic ML
    in particular is doomed to failure. A depth of understanding of the foundations
    of these domains is pivotal to having any chance of succeeding. This book is a
    primer that endeavors to give the thinking practitioner a solid grounding in the
    foundational concepts of probabilistic ML and how to apply it to finance and investing
    problems, using simple math and Python code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is another reason why I wrote this book. To this day, books are still
    a medium for serious discourse. I wanted to remind the readers about the continued
    grave flaws of modern financial theory and conventional statistical inference
    methodology. It is outrageous that these pseudoscientific methods are still taught
    in academia and practiced in industry despite their deep flaws and pathetic performance.
    They continue to waste billions of research dollars producing junk studies, tarnish
    the reputation of the scientific enterprise, and contribute significantly to economic
    disasters and human misery.

- en: We are at a crossroads in the evolution of AI technologies, with most experts
    predicting exponential growth in its use, fundamentally transforming the way we
    live, work, and interact with one another. The danger that AI systems will take
    over humanity imminently is silly science fiction, because even the most advanced
    AI system lacks the common sense of a toddler. The real clear and present danger
    is that fools might end up developing and managing these powerful savants based
    on the spurious models of conventional finance and statistics. This will most
    likely lead to catastrophes faster and bigger than we have ever experienced before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My criticisms are supported by simple math, common sense, data, and scholarly
    works that have been published over the past century. Perhaps one added value
    of this book is in retrieving many of those forgotten academic publications from
    the dusty archives of history and making readers aware of their insights in plain,
    unequivocal language using logic, simple math, or code that anyone with a high
    school degree can understand. Clearly, the conventional mode of expressing these
    criticisms hasn’t worked at all. The stakes for individuals, society, and the
    scientific enterprise are too high for us to care if plainly spoken mathematical
    and scientific truths might offend someone or tarnish a reputation built on authoring
    or supporting bogus theories.

    is a less wrong, more useful model for these problem domains. The singular focus
    of this primer is on understanding the foundations of this complex, multidisciplinary
    field. Only pivotal concepts and applications are covered. Sometimes less is indeed
