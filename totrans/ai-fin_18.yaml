    based on the systematic and strategic application of AI. [“AI and Finance”](#ai_and_finance)
    serves as a review and summary of the importance that AI might have for the future
    of finance. [“Lack of Standardization”](#lack_of_standardization) argues that
    AI in finance is still at a nascent stage, making the implementation in many instances
    anything but straightforward. This, on the other hand, leaves the competitive
    landscape wide open for financial players to secure competitive advantages through
    AI. The rise of AI in finance requires a rethinking and redesign of finance education
    and training. Today’s requirements cannot be met anymore by traditional finance
    curricula. [“Fight for Resources”](#fight_for_resources) discusses how financial
    institutions will fight for necessary resources to apply AI at a large scale in
    finance. As in many other areas, AI experts are often the bottleneck for which
    financial companies compete with technology companies, startups, and companies
    from other industries.

    nowadays, still to be found but only at small scales and in many cases to be mined
    only with industrial effort. [“Competitive Scenarios”](#competitive_scenarios)
    discusses reasons for and against future scenarios for the financial industry
    characterized by a monopoly, oligopoly, or perfect competition. Finally, [“Risks,
    Regulation, and Oversight”](#risks_regulation_oversight) has a brief look at risks
    arising from AI in finance in general and major problems regulators and industry
    watchdogs are faced with.'

    of financial time series. The goal is to discover *statistical inefficiencies*,
    situations in which the AI algorithm outperforms a baseline algorithm in predicting
    future market movements. Such statistical inefficiencies are the basis for *economic
    inefficiencies*. An economic inefficiency requires that there be a trading strategy
    that can exploit the statistical inefficiency in such a way that above-market
    returns are realized. In other words, there is a strategy—composed of the prediction
    algorithm and an execution algorithm—that generates *alpha*.

    With regard to the flash crash in 2010, for which algorithmic trading was blamed

    trading might pose a similar risk when more and more institutions apply similar
    approaches that have proven fruitful. Other areas are also prone to such an effect.

    and regulators. Nevertheless, it is safe to predict that tighter regulation and
    oversight addressing AI in finance specifically is certainly to come in many jurisdictions.

    The benefits are clear in many application areas. However, so far hardly any standards
    have been established, and the field seems still wide open for players to strive
    for competitive advantages. Because new technologies and approaches from data
    science, machine learning, deep learning, and more generally AI infiltrate almost
    any financial discipline, education and training in finance must take this into
    account. Many master’s programs have already adjusted their curricula, while big
    financial institutions invest heavily in training incoming and existing staff
    in the required skills. Beyond human resources, financial institutions also compete
    for other resources in the field, such as alternative data. In the financial markets,
    AI-powered investment and trading make it harder to identify sustainable alpha
    opportunities. On the other hand, with traditional econometric methods it might
    be impossible today to identify and mine microscopic alpha.

    at a point when AI has taken over. Scenarios ranging from a monopoly to an oligopoly
    to perfect competition seem still reasonable. [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#financial_singularity)
    revisits this topic. AI-first finance confronts researchers, practitioners, and
    regulators with new risks and new challenges in addressing these risks appropriately.
    One such risk, playing a prominent role in many discussions, is the black box
    characteristic of many AI algorithms. Such a risk usually can only be mitigated
    to some extent with today’s state-of-the-art explainable AI.
