<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Introducing Technical Analysis</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="technical analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_5.html0"/>Technical analysis presents many types of inputs (explanatory variables) that you can use in your deep learning models. This chapter introduces this vast field so that you are equipped with the necessary knowledge to create technical-based learning models in the chapters to follow.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Technical analysis</em> in finance relies on the visual interpretation of a price action’s history to determine the likely aggregate direction of the market. It relies on the idea that the past is the best predictor of the future. There are several types of techniques within the vast field that is technical analysis, notably the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Charting analysis</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This is where you apply subjective visual interpretation techniques onto charts. You generally use methods like drawing support and resistance lines as well as retracements to find inflection levels that aim to determine the next move.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Indicator analysis</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This is where you use mathematical formulas to create objective indicators that can be either trend following or contrarian. Among known indicators are <em>moving averages</em> and the <em>relative strength index</em> (RSI), both of which are discussed in greater detail in this chapter.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>Pattern recognition</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This is where you monitor certain recurring configurations and act on them. A <em>pattern </em>is generally an event that emerges from time to time and presents a certain theoretical or empirical outcome. In finance, it is more complicated, but certain patterns have been shown to add value across time, and this may partly be due to a phenomenon called <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> (a process by which an initial expectation leads to its confirmation).</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s take a quick tour of the history of technical analysis so that you have a better idea of what to expect. Technical analysis relies on three principles:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>History repeats itself</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>You are likely to see clusters during trends and ranges. Also, certain configurations are likely to have a similar outcome most of the time.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>The market discounts everything</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>It is assumed that everything (all fundamental, technical, and quantitative information) is included in the current price.</p></dd>&#13;
	&#13;
	<dt>The market moves in waves</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>Due to different time frames and needs, traders buy and sell at different frequencies, therefore creating trends and waves as opposed to a straight line.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Unfortunately, technical analysis is overhyped and misused by the retail trading community, which gives it a somewhat less-than-savory reputation in the professional industry. Every type of analysis has its strengths and weaknesses, and there are successful fundamental, technical, and quantitative investors, but there are also failed investors from the three fields.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fundamental analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="id515"/><em>Fundamental analysis</em> relies on economic and financial data to deliver a judgment on a specific security or currency with a long-term investment horizon, whereas <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="market efficiency" data-type="indexterm" id="id516"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="quantitative analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="id517"/><em>quantitative analysis</em> is more versatile and is more often applied to short-term data. It uses mathematical and statistical concepts to deliver a forecast or to manage risk.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Among other assumptions, technical analysis suggests that markets are not efficient, but what does that mean? <em>Market efficiency</em> states that information is already embedded in the current price and that price and value are the same thing. When you buy an asset, you are hoping that it is <em>undervalued</em> (in fundamental analysis jargon) or <em>oversold</em> (in technical analysis jargon), which is why you believe the price should go up to meet the value. Therefore, you are assuming that the value is greater than the price.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="alpha trading" data-type="indexterm" id="id518"/>Market efficiency rebuffs any claims that the price does not equal the value and therefore suggests that any alpha trading must not result in above-average returns (<em>alpha trading</em> is the act of engaging in speculative operations to perform better than a benchmark, which is typically an index).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The market efficiency hypothesis is the technical analyst’s greatest enemy, as one of its principles is that in the weak form of efficiency, you cannot earn excess returns from technical analysis. Hence, technical analysis gets shot down right at the beginning, and then fundamental analysis gets its share of the beating.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">It is fair to assume that at some point in the future, markets will have no choice but to be efficient due to the number of participants and the ease of access to information. However, as political and abnormal events show us, markets tend to be anything but efficient.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>An example of a political event that triggered panic and irrationality in the markets is the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022. An example of an abnormal economic event is an unexpected interest rate hike from a central bank.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="candlestick charts" data-secondary="charting analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_5.html1"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="charting analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_5.html2"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="technical analysis" data-secondary="charting analysis" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_5.html3"/>Before you can understand what charting analysis is, you need to know what you see when opening a chart—or more specifically, a candlestick chart.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s assume that the market for a particular stock opens at $100. Some trading activity occurs. Let’s also record the high price ($102) and the low price ($98) printed during the hourly period. Also, record the hourly close price ($101). Recall that these four pieces of data are referred to as <em>open</em>, <em>high</em>, <em>low</em>, and <em>close</em> (OHLC). They represent the four basic prices that are necessary to create candlestick charts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Candlesticks </em>are extremely simple and intuitive. They are box-shaped chronological elements across the timeline that contain the OHLC data. <a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-1">Figure 5-1</a> shows everything you need to know about how a candlestick works.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figure-5-1"><img alt="" class="iimagesdlf_0401png" src="assets/dlff_0501.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-1. </span>On the left, a bullish candlestick; on the right, a bearish candlestick</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>bullish </em>candlestick has a close price higher than its open price, whereas a <em>bearish </em>candlestick has a close price lower than its open price.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Candlestick charts are among the most common ways to analyze financial time series. They contain more information than simple line charts and offer more visual interpretability than bar charts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>A <em>line chart</em> is created by joining the close prices chronologically. It is the simplest way to chart an asset. It contains the least information among the three chart types since it shows only the close price.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Charting analysis</em> is the task of finding support and resistance lines through subjective drawing. <em>Lines</em>, whether horizontal or diagonal, are the essence of finding the following levels to predict the market’s reaction:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Support level</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="support level" data-type="indexterm" id="id519"/>A level from where the market should bounce, as it is implied that demand should be higher than the supply around it</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Resistance level</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resistance level" data-type="indexterm" id="id520"/>A level from where the market should retreat, as it is implied that supply should be higher than the demand around it</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The asset’s direction on a timeline axis can be threefold: <em>uptrend</em>, where prices are making higher highs; <em>downtrend</em>, where prices are making lower lows; and <em>sideways</em> (or ranging), where prices fluctuate around the same level for extended periods of time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-2">Figure 5-2</a> shows a horizontal support level on the EURUSD (the value of one euro priced in US dollars) close to 1.0840. Generally, traders start thinking about buying when a price is close to support. This is in anticipation of a reaction to the upside since the balance of power should shift more to the demand (positive) side, where traders accept paying a higher price as they expect an even higher price in the future (remember the price-to-value argument discussed earlier). The implication here is that most traders see a price that is lower than the value.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-2. </span>Candlestick chart on the EURUSD showing support at 1.0840</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-3">Figure 5-3</a> shows a resistance level on the USDCHF (the value of one US dollar priced in Swiss francs) close to 0.9030. Generally, traders&#13;
start thinking about shorting the market when it is close to resistance. This is in anticipation that a reaction to the downside should occur since the balance of power should shift more to the supply side. The implication here is that most traders see a price that is higher than the value.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-3. </span>Candlestick chart on the USDCHF showing resistance at 0.9030</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Ranging (sideways) markets give more confidence that horizontal support and <span class="keep-together">resistance</span> lines will work. This is because of the already implied general balance between supply and demand. Therefore, if there is excess supply, the market would adjust quickly, as demand should rise enough to stabilize the price.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-4">Figure 5-4</a> shows a ranging market trapped between two horizontal levels; this is the case of the USDCAD (the value of one US dollar priced in Canadian dollars). Whenever the market approaches the resistance line in a ranging market, you should have more confidence that a drop will occur than you would in a rising market, and whenever it approaches support, you should have more confidence that a bounce will occur than you would in a falling market.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Charting analysis is also applied on trending markets. This comes in the form of ascending and descending channels. They share the same inclination as horizontal levels but with a bias (discussed later).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figure-5-4"><img alt="" class="iimagesdlf_0404png" src="assets/dlff_0504.png"/>&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-5">Figure 5-5</a> shows an <em>ascending channel </em>where support and resistance points rise over time to reflect the bullish pressure stemming from a steadily rising demand force.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Traders seeing this would anticipate a bullish reaction whenever the market approaches the lower part of the ascending channel and would expect a bearish reaction whenever the market approaches the upper part of the channel.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This has no sound scientific backing, because nothing says that the market must move in parallel, but the self-fulfilling prophecy may be why such channels are considered predictive in nature.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-6">Figure 5-6</a> shows a descending channel where support and resistance points fall with time to reflect the bearish pressure coming from a steadily rising supply force. Generally, bearish channels tend to be more aggressive as fear dominates greed, and sellers are more panicky than buyers are greedy.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before"><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="invisible hand" data-type="indexterm" id="id521"/>I mentioned a bias when dealing with ascending and descending channels. I refer to this bias as the <em>invisible hand</em>. Here’s why:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>“The trend is your friend.” This saying, coined by stock investor, investment adviser, and financial analyst Martin Zweig, means that with ascending channels, you need to be focusing more on buying whenever the market reverts to the support zone. That’s because you want the invisible hand of the bullish pressure to increase your probability of a winning trade. Similarly, in the case of a descending channel, you should focus more on short selling whenever the market reaches the upper limit. The full version of Zweig’s axiom goes as follows: “The trend is your friend, until the end when it bends.” This means that at any point in time, the market may change its regime, and any friendship with the trend gets terminated. In the end, charting analysis is subjective in nature and relies more on the experience of the trader or analyst.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It is worth mentioning that there are many ways to find support and <span class="keep-together">resistance</span> levels other than drawing them through visual estimation:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Fibonacci retracements</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Fibonacci retracements" data-type="indexterm" id="id522"/>This is where you use Fibonacci ratios to give out reactionary levels. Fibonacci retracements are usually calculated on up or down legs so that you know where the market will reverse if it touches one of these levels. The problem with this method is that it is very subjective and, as with any other technique, not perfect. The advantage is that it gives many interesting levels.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Pivot points</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pivot points" data-type="indexterm" id="id523"/>With pivot points, you use simple mathematical formulas to find levels. Based on yesterday’s trading activity, you use formulas to project today’s future support and resistance levels. Then, whenever the market approaches the levels, you try to fade the move by trading in the opposite direction.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Moving averages</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>These are discussed in the next section. They are dynamic in nature and follow the price. You can also use them to detect the current market regime.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>The best way to find support and resistance levels is to combine as many techniques as possible so that you have a certain confluence of methods, which in turn will increase your conviction for the initial idea. Trading is a numbers game, and stacking the odds on your side as much as possible should eventually increase your chances for a better-performing system.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="id524"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html2" data-type="indexterm" id="id525"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html1" data-type="indexterm" id="id526"/></p>&#13;

Its simplicity makes it without a doubt one of the most sought-after tools. Moving averages help confirm and ride the trend.

<p>Rules of thumb with moving averages include the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
	<li>Whenever the market is above its moving average, a bullish momentum is in progress, and you are better off looking for long opportunities.</li>&#13;
	<li>Whenever the market is below its moving average, a bearish momentum is in progress, and you are better off looking for short opportunities.</li>&#13;
	<li>Whenever the market crosses over or under its moving average, you can say that the momentum has changed and that the market may be entering a new <span class="keep-together">regime (trend).</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can also combine moving averages so that they give out signals. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="golden cross" data-type="indexterm" id="id531"/>For example, whenever a short-term moving average crosses over a long-term moving average, a bullish crossover has occurred, and the market may continue to rise.

&#13;
<ol>&#13;
	<li>Calculate the change in the closing prices from the previous ones.</li>&#13;
	<li>Separate the positive net changes from the negative net changes.</li>&#13;
	<li>Calculate a smoothed moving average on the positive net changes and on the absolute values of the negative net changes.</li>&#13;
	<li>Divide the smoothed positive changes by the smoothed absolute negative changes. Refer to this calculation as the <em>relative strength</em> (RS).</li>&#13;

	<li>Whenever the RSI surpasses or breaks the 50 level, a new trend might be emerging, but this is generally a weak assumption and more theoretical than practical in nature.</li>&#13;

Patterns can be divided into the following types:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Classic price patterns</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="classic price patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="id543"/>These are known as technical reversal price patterns, which are extremely subjective and can be considered unreliable due to the difficulty of backtesting them without taking subjective conditions. However, they are still used by many <span class="keep-together">traders</span> and analysts.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Timing patterns</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="timing patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="id544"/>Based on a combination of timing and price, these patterns are less well known but can be powerful and predictive when used correctly.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Candlestick patterns<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch05.html#id545" id="id545-marker">4</a></sup></dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="candlestick patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="id546"/>This is where OHLC data is used to predict the future reaction of the market. Candlesticks are one of the best ways to visualize a chart as they harbor many patterns that could signal reversals or confirm the move.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Classic price patterns refer to theoretical configurations such as double tops and rectangles. They are usually either reversal or continuation patterns:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>Continuation price patterns</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="continuation price patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="id547"/>These are configurations that confirm the aggregate ongoing move. Examples include rectangles and triangles.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>Reversal price patterns</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="reversal price patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="id548"/>These are configurations that fade the aggregate ongoing move. Examples include head and shoulders and double bottoms.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Old-school chartists are familiar with double tops and bottoms, which signal reversals and give the potential of said reversals. Despite their simplicity, they are subjective, and some are not visible like others.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="double top pattern" data-type="indexterm" id="Chapter_5.html13"/>This hinders the ability to know whether they add value or not. <a data-type="xref" href="#figure-5-10">Figure 5-10</a> shows an illustration of a double top where a bearish bias is given right after the validation of the pattern, which is usually breaking the line linking the lows of the bottom between the two tops. This line is called the <em>neckline</em>.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-10. </span>Double top illustration</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Notice these three important elements in a double top:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<dl>&#13;
	<dt>The neckline</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This is the line linking the lowest low between the two peaks and the beginning/end of the pattern. It serves to determine the pullback level.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>The pullback</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>Having broken the neckline, the market should shape a desperate attempt toward the neckline but fails to continue higher as the sellers use this level as a reentry to continue shorting. Therefore, the pullback level is the theoretical optimal selling point after validating a double top.</p></dd>&#13;
	<dt>The potential</dt>&#13;
	<dd><p>This is the target of the double top. It is measured as the midpoint between the top of the pattern and the neckline projected lower and starting from the same neckline point.</p></dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The double top or bottom can have any size, but preferably it should be visible to most market participants so that its impact is bigger. Theoretically, the pattern’s psychological explanation is that with the second top or bottom, the market has failed to push the prices beyond the first peak and therefore is showing weakness, which might be exploited by the seller.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html13" data-type="indexterm" id="id549"/></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">There are other patterns that are more objective in nature; that is, they have clear rules of detection and initiation. These are all based on clear objective conditions and are not subject to the analyst’s discretion. This facilitates their backtesting and <span class="keep-together">evaluation.</span></p>&#13;

<p>Technical analysis offers a big selection of tools to analyze the markets either mathematically, graphically, or even psychologically (through patterns). The learning outcome of this chapter is to understand what technical analysis is and what the technical indicators are so that you are familiar with them when used as explanatory variables (as is the case in <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a>)<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html12" data-type="indexterm" id="id550"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html11" data-type="indexterm" id="id551"/>.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="Chapter_5.html0" data-type="indexterm" id="id552"/></p>&#13;
