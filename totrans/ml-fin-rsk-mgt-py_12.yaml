- en: Do you think that the quality of corporate governance can be assessed using
    a risk measure? According to recent studies, the answer is yes. The link between
    corporate governance and risk measure has been established via *stock price crash
    risk*, which is referred to as the risk of a large negative individual stock return.
    This association triggered a lot of research in this field.

- en: The importance of detecting the determinants of stock price crash lies in identifying
    the root causes of low (or high) quality corporate governance. Identifying these
    root causes help a company to concentrate on problematic managerial areas, enhancing
    the functioning performance of the company as well as improving its reputation.
    This, in turn, lowers the risk of stock price crash and increases the company’s
    total revenue.

- en: Stock price crash provides a signal for investors and risk managers about the
    weakness and strength of a company’s *corporate governance*. Corporate governance
    is defined as the way corporations are directed and controlled, as well as the
    ways they are or are not “promoting corporate fairness, transparency, and accountability”
    (Wolfensohn 1999).

- en: Accountability is an instrument for controlling *agency cost*, which is a cost
    arising from competing interests of shareholders and management. Agency cost is
    another source of asymmetric information because managers and shareholders do
    not have the same amount of information. Conflict arises when managers’ and shareholders’
    interests diverge. More precisely, managers are, on the one hand, willing to maximize
    their own power and wealth. On the other hand, shareholders are looking for a
    way to maximize shareholder values. These two goals may conflict, and because
    of the informational superiority of managers, some company policies may be intended
    to increase the power and wealth of the managers at the expense of shareholder
    interests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, stock price crash may be a warning sign about the quality of corporate
    governance. For instance, in the presence of information asymmetry, agency theory
    suggests that outside stakeholders let managers generate more opaque financial
    reports to withhold bad news (Hutton, Marcus, and Tehranian 2009). The more recent
    explanation of this phenomenon is known as *discretionary-disclosure* theory (Bae,
    Lim, and Wei 2006). According to this theory, firms prefer to announce good news
    immediately, but they stockpile negative information. When the accumulated negative
    information reaches a tipping point, it will cause a large decline. Since concealing
    bad news about a firm prevents taking timely corrective actions, once the accumulated
    bad news is released to the market, investors will revise their future expectations,
    and there will inevitably be a sudden decline in prices, which is called *crash
    risk* (Hutton, Marcus, and Tehranian 2009 and Kim 2011).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, opaque financial reporting, which is related to the accountability
    principle, creates an environment in which managers are unwilling to disclose
    bad news. This results in an unfair presentation of the financial position of
    a company and, in turn, increases the likelihood of future stock price crash (Bleck
    and Liu (2007), Myers (2006), and Kim and Zhang (2013)).

    leads to large declines.
