  zh: 后记
- en: This book tries to show how ML and deep learning models can be incorporated
    to address financial problems. This, of course, does not mean that the book includes
    all models with all necessary steps required to deploy models in the industry,
    but I have tried to focus on the topics I felt would be of the greatest interest
    to the reader.

  zh: 本书试图展示如何将机器学习和深度学习模型整合起来解决金融问题。当然，这并不意味着本书包含了所有必要步骤以在行业中部署模型，但我尽力聚焦于我认为读者最感兴趣的主题。
- en: Recent developments in AI indicate that almost all traditional financial models
    are outperformed by AI models in terms of predictive performance, and I believe
    that adopting these models and having improved predictive performance in the industry
    will help finance practitioners make better decisions.

  zh: AI的最新发展表明，几乎所有传统的金融模型在预测性能方面都被AI模型超越，我相信采用这些模型并在行业中获得改进的预测性能将帮助金融从业者做出更好的决策。
- en: However, despite these developments and recent hype around AI, the deployment
    level of AI models is not even close to where it should be. The opaque nature
    of these models stands out as the first and foremost reason. However, there are
    constant and tremendous improvements toward getting more explainable AI models,
    and these orchestrated efforts have started to pay off, as Prado has argued, whether
    ML is opaque or not depends on the person using it, not on the ML algorithms themselves.

  zh: 然而，尽管这些发展和围绕AI的最近炒作，AI模型的部署水平远未达到应有的水平。这些模型的不透明性显然是首要原因。不过，不断进行的大幅改进努力使得获得更可解释的AI模型成为可能，正如普拉多所主张的那样，ML是否不透明取决于使用它的人，而不是ML算法本身。
- en: Thus, in my opinion, the long tradition of using parametric models as well as
    resistance to paradigm shift are the primary reasons for the slow and reluctant
    adoption of AI models.

  zh: 因此，在我看来，长期使用参数模型以及对范式转变的抵制是慢慢而不情愿地接受AI模型的主要原因。
- en: Hopefully, this book paves the way for embracing AI models and provides a smooth
    and convenient transition to using them.
