    based on the systematic and strategic application of AI. [“AI and Finance”](#ai_and_finance)
    serves as a review and summary of the importance that AI might have for the future
    of finance. [“Lack of Standardization”](#lack_of_standardization) argues that
    AI in finance is still at a nascent stage, making the implementation in many instances
    anything but straightforward. This, on the other hand, leaves the competitive
    landscape wide open for financial players to secure competitive advantages through
    AI. The rise of AI in finance requires a rethinking and redesign of finance education
    and training. Today’s requirements cannot be met anymore by traditional finance
    curricula. [“Fight for Resources”](#fight_for_resources) discusses how financial
    institutions will fight for necessary resources to apply AI at a large scale in
    finance. As in many other areas, AI experts are often the bottleneck for which
    financial companies compete with technology companies, startups, and companies
    from other industries.

    only with industrial effort. [“Competitive Scenarios”](#competitive_scenarios)
    discusses reasons for and against future scenarios for the financial industry
    characterized by a monopoly, oligopoly, or perfect competition. Finally, [“Risks,
    Regulation, and Oversight”](#risks_regulation_oversight) has a brief look at risks
    arising from AI in finance in general and major problems regulators and industry

    of financial time series. The goal is to discover *statistical inefficiencies*,
    situations in which the AI algorithm outperforms a baseline algorithm in predicting
    future market movements. Such statistical inefficiencies are the basis for *economic
    inefficiencies*. An economic inefficiency requires that there be a trading strategy
    that can exploit the statistical inefficiency in such a way that above-market
    returns are realized. In other words, there is a strategy—composed of the prediction
    algorithm and an execution algorithm—that generates *alpha*.

    There are numerous research papers published essentially on a daily basis (for
    example, on [*http://arxiv.org*](http://arxiv.org)). Among other reasons, this
    is due to the fact that traditional publication venues with peer review are in
    general too slow to keep up with the fast pace in the field of AI. Researchers
    are keen to share their work with the public as fast as possible, often to not
    be outpaced by competing teams. A peer review process, which also has its merits
    in terms of quality assurance, might take months, during which the research would
    not be published. In that sense, researchers more and more trust in the community
    to take care of the review while also ensuring early credit for their discoveries.

    of econometric research some decades ago (in the form of limited data availability
    and limited compute power, for example). But it also often leads to the idea of

    and describe possible paths for all three of them. For example, an argument for
    a monopoly might be that a major breakthrough in algorithmic trading, for example,
    might lead to a fast, significant outperformance that helps accumulate more capital
    through reinvestments, as well as through new inflows. This in turn increases
    the available technology and research budget to protect the competitive advantage
    and attracts talent that would be otherwise hard to win over. This whole cycle

    core online advertising business—is a good one in this context.

    part of the budget. As in other fields, say, recommender engines—think Amazon
    for books, Netflix for films, and Spotify for music—multiple companies might be

    or even might be unable to generate returns distinguishable from plain market
    returns.

    share in investment management that is comparable to Google in search. At the
    same time, the number of small, medium-sized, and large players doing research
    in the field and the low barriers of entry in algorithmic trading make it unlikely
    that a select few can secure defendable competitive advantages. An argument against
    perfect competition is that, in the foreseeable future, algorithmic trading at
    a large scale requires a huge amount of capital and other resources. With regard
    to chess, DeepMind has shown with AlphaZero that there is always room for innovation
    and significant improvements, even if a field almost seems settled once and for

    scale requires the use of—at least partly—private data from customers. This increases
    the risk that private data will be leaked or used in inappropriate ways. Such
    a risk obviously does not arise when publicly available data sources, such as
    for financial time series data, are used.

    as objective in, say, judging the creditworthiness of a potential debtor as the
    data allows.^([2](ch13.xhtml#idm45625238800792)) Again, the problem of learning
    biases is not really a problem when working with market data, for instance.

- en: In many areas, it is important that decisions can be explained, sometimes in
    detail and in hindsight. This might be required by law or by investors wanting
    to understand why particular investment decisions have been taken. Take the example
    of investment and trading decisions. If an AI, based on a large neural network,
    decides *algorithmically* when and what to trade, it might be pretty difficult
    and often impossible to explain in detail why the AI has traded the way it has.
    Researchers work actively and intensively on [“explainable AI,”](https://oreil.ly/P3YFQ)
    but there are obvious limits in this regard.

- en: Since the stock market crash of 1987, it is clear what kind of risk herding
    in financial trading represents. In 1987, positive feedback trading in the context
    of large-scale synthetic replication programs for put options—in combination with
    stop loss orders—triggered the downward spiral. A similar herding effect could
    be observed in the 2008 hedge fund meltdown, which for the first time revealed
    the extent to which different hedge funds implement similar kinds of strategies.
    With regard to the flash crash in 2010, for which algorithmic trading was blamed
    by some, the evidence seems unclear. However, the more widespread use of AI in
    trading might pose a similar risk when more and more institutions apply similar
    approaches that have proven fruitful. Other areas are also prone to such an effect.
    Credit decision agents might learn the same biases based on different data sets
    and might make it impossible for certain groups or individuals to get credit at
    all.

    competitive advantages, it is hardly ever transparent what a single institution
    does in this regard and how exactly it is implemented and used. Many treat their
    effort in this context as intellectual property and their own “secret sauce.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Model validation is a central risk management and regulatory tool in many financial
    areas. Take the simple example of the pricing of a European option based on the
    Black-Scholes-Merton (1973) option pricing model. The prices that a specific implementation
    of the model generates can be validated, for example, by the use of the Cox et
    al. (1979) binomial option pricing model—and vice versa. This is often quite different
    with AI algorithms. There is hardly ever a model that, based on a parsimonious
    set of parameters, can validate the outputs of a complex AI algorithm. Reproducibility
    might be, however, an attainable goal (that is, the option to have third parties
    verify the outputs based on an exact replication of all steps involved). But this
    in turn would require the third party, say, a regulator or an auditor, to have
    access to the same data, an infrastructure as powerful as the one used by the
    financial institution, and so on. For larger AI efforts, this seems simply unrealistic.

- en: Back to the option pricing example, a regulator can specify that both the Black-Scholes-Merton
    (1973) and the Cox et al. (1979) option pricing models are acceptable for the
    pricing of European options. Even when lawmakers and regulators specify that both
    support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and neural networks are “acceptable algorithms,”
    this leaves open how these algorithms are trained, used, and so on. It is difficult
    to be more specific in this context. For example, should a regulator limit the
    number of hidden layers and/or hidden units in a neural network? What about the
    software packages to be used? The list of hard questions seems endless. Therefore,
    only general rules will be formulated.

    The benefits are clear in many application areas. However, so far hardly any standards
    have been established, and the field seems still wide open for players to strive
    for competitive advantages. Because new technologies and approaches from data
    science, machine learning, deep learning, and more generally AI infiltrate almost
    any financial discipline, education and training in finance must take this into
    account. Many master’s programs have already adjusted their curricula, while big
    financial institutions invest heavily in training incoming and existing staff
    in the required skills. Beyond human resources, financial institutions also compete
    for other resources in the field, such as alternative data. In the financial markets,
    AI-powered investment and trading make it harder to identify sustainable alpha
    opportunities. On the other hand, with traditional econometric methods it might
    be impossible today to identify and mine microscopic alpha.

    at a point when AI has taken over. Scenarios ranging from a monopoly to an oligopoly
    to perfect competition seem still reasonable. [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#financial_singularity)
    revisits this topic. AI-first finance confronts researchers, practitioners, and
    regulators with new risks and new challenges in addressing these risks appropriately.
    One such risk, playing a prominent role in many discussions, is the black box
    characteristic of many AI algorithms. Such a risk usually can only be mitigated
    to some extent with today’s state-of-the-art explainable AI.
