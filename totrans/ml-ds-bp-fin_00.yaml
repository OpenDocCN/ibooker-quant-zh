- en: The value of machine learning (ML) in finance is becoming more apparent each
    day. Machine learning is expected to become crucial to the functioning of financial
    markets. Analysts, portfolio managers, traders, and chief investment officers
    should all be familiar with ML techniques. For banks and other financial institutions
    striving to improve financial analysis, streamline processes, and increase security,
    ML is becoming the technology of choice. The use of ML in institutions is an increasing
    trend, and its potential for improving various systems can be observed in trading
    strategies, pricing, and risk management.

- en: Although machine learning is making significant inroads across all verticals
    of the financial services industry, there is a gap between the ideas and the implementation
    of machine learning algorithms. A plethora of material is available on the web
    in these areas, yet very little is organized. Additionally, most of the literature
    is limited to trading algorithms only. *Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints
    for Finance* fills this void and provides a machine learning toolbox customized
    for the financal market that allows the readers to be part of the machine learning
    revolution. This book is not limited to investing or trading strategies; it focuses
    on leveraging the art and craft of building ML-driven algorithms that are crucial
    in the finance industry.

- en: Implementing machine learning models in finance is easier than commonly believed.
    There is also a misconception that big data is needed for building machine learning
    models. The case studies in this book span almost all areas of machine learning
    and aim to handle such misconceptions. This book not only will cover the theory
    and case studies related to using ML in trading strategies but also will delve
    deep into other critical “need-to-know” concepts such as portfolio management,
    derivative pricing, fraud detection, corporate credit ratings, robo-advisor development,
    and chatbot development. It will address real-life problems faced by practitioners
    and provide scientifically sound solutions supported by code and examples.

    will be useful and serve as a starting point for industry practitioners working
    on their projects. The examples and case studies shown in the book demonstrate
    techniques that can easily be applied to a wide range of datasets. The futuristic
    case studies, such as reinforcement learning for trading, building a robo-advisor,
    and using machine learning for instrument pricing, inspire readers to think outside
    the box and motivate them to make the best of the models and data available.

    reinforcement learning for trading cryptocurrency or an investment bank quant
    is looking for machine learning–based techniques to improve the calibration speed
    of pricing models, this book will add value. The theory, concepts, and codebase
    mentioned in the book will be extremely useful at every step of the model development
    lifecycle, from idea generation to model implementation. Readers can use the shared
    codebase and test the proposed solutions themselves, allowing for a hands-on reader
    experience. The readers should have a basic knowledge of statistics, machine learning,
    and Python.
