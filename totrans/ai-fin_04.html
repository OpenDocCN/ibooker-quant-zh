<p>If there is one industry that would greatly benefit from the genuine adoption of
artificial intelligence, it is investment management.</p>

<p>This part consists of four chapters. It covers topics central to the understanding of why data-driven finance, artificial intelligence, and machine learning will have a lasting impact on financial theory and practice.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#normative_finance">Chapter 3</a> sets the stage with important and popular financial theories and models that have been considered cornerstones of finance for decades. It covers, among others, mean-variance portfolio (MVP) theory and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#data_driven_finance">Chapter 4</a> discusses how the programmatic availability of ever more historical and real-time financial data has reshaped finance from a theory-driven to a data-driven discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#machine_learning">Chapter 5</a> is about machine learning as a general approach, abstracting from 
<span class="keep-together">specific</span> algorithms to a large extent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#ai_first_finance">Chapter 6</a> discusses on a general level how the emergence of data-driven finance in combination with artificial intelligence and machine learning leads to a paradigm shift in finance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
