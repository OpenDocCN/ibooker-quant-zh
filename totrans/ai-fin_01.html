<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-seealso="AI-first finance" id="idm45625335292328"/>This part is about artificial intelligence (AI) in general: <em>artificial</em> in the sense that the intelligence is not displayed by a biological organism but rather by a machine, and <em>intelligence</em> as defined by AI researcher Max Tegmark as the “ability to accomplish complex goals.” This part introduces central notions and algorithms from the AI field, gives examples of major recent breakthroughs, and discusses aspects of superintelligence. It consists of two chapters:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#artificial_intelligence">Chapter 1</a> introduces general notions, ideas, and definitions from the field of AI. It also provides several Python examples of how different algorithms can be applied in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#superintelligence">Chapter 2</a> discusses concepts and topics related to artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence (SI). These types of intelligence relate to AI agents that have reached at least human-level intelligence in all domains and super-human intelligence in certain domains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
