  zh: 股票市场
- en: Strong economic conditions often lead to higher corporate profits as businesses
    experience higher revenues and sales. This boost in earnings can drive stock prices
    higher, as investors expect better returns from companies. It also results in
    higher consumer spending. This can benefit companies that rely heavily on consumer
    purchases, such as retail and consumer goods companies, which may experience increased
    sales and profitability. Additionally, a strong economy instills confidence in
    investors, leading them to be more willing to take on risk and invest in the stock
    market (as opposed to the fixed income market). Positive sentiment can attract
    more buyers, leading to a rise in stock prices (which may also attract speculative
    traders who will push prices even higher). It is also possible that central banks
    may implement policies to effectively control inflation, which can be positive
    for stocks. Moderate inflation rates and low interest rates can encourage borrowing,
    investment, and business expansion.

- en: As the economy strengthens, central banks may increase interest rates to prevent
    overheating and control inflation. Rising interest rates lead to higher yields
    on new bonds, making existing bonds with lower yields less attractive. As a result,
    bond prices may decline, especially for long-term bonds. Additionally, when the
    economy is strong and businesses are performing well, investors may prefer to
    allocate more of their funds to the potentially higher returns offered by the
    stock market rather than fixed income investments. The same reasoning applies
    to the fact that there will be lower demand for safe haven assets such as government
    bonds as investors are more confident about the overall economic outlook. Consequently,
    demand for such bonds may decrease, putting downward pressure on prices.

  zh: 随着经济的增强，央行可能会提高利率，以防止经济过热并控制通胀。新债券的高收益率使得现有收益较低的债券变得不那么吸引人。因此，尤其是对于长期债券，债券价格可能会下降。此外，当经济强劲且企业业绩良好时，投资者可能更倾向于将资金配置到股票市场上，因为那里可能会有更高的回报。同样的推理也适用于安全避风港资产（如政府债券）需求较低的情况，因为投资者对整体经济前景更为乐观。因此，这类债券的需求可能会减少，对价格构成下行压力。

- en: A strong economy typically translates to higher industrial production and increased
    consumer spending. As a result, the demand for commodities, especially industrial
    metals like copper and steel, tends to rise due to their use in manufacturing
    and construction. Economic growth also leads to higher energy consumption. Therefore,
    oil and natural gas demand often increases, pushing their prices upward. Rising
    inflation expectations is a result of a growing economy, and this may lead investors
    to turn to precious metals (such as gold and silver) as a hedge against currency
    devaluation and market uncertainties. Finally, agricultural commodities (such
    as wheat and corn) may also witness a rise due to increased consumer spending
    on food products.

    economy, leading to increased demand for assets denominated in that currency.
    As demand for the domestic currency rises, its value appreciates relative to other
    currencies in the foreign exchange market. Central banks may raise interest rates
    to manage the rising inflation and ensure economic stability. Higher interest
    rates attract foreign investors seeking better returns, driving up demand for
    the domestic currency and pushing its value higher. Similarly, a strong economy
    often leads to increased exports, as domestic goods and services become more competitive
    globally. This can improve the country’s trade balance and contribute to a stronger

    on gold at $1,500 in anticipation that it will go to $2,000, you may place your
    stop-loss order at $1,250 so that if the price drops to $1,250, you limit your
    losses to no more than $250\. At the same time, your anticipation of selling when

    since conditions were created at the end of the analyzed period. Market technicians
    overestimate their abilities when they see that some techniques worked well in
    the past but fail to take into account the environment of the tested period. Also,
    some configurations do not look the same when they’re happening as when they are
    complete. Hindsight bias can be hard to cure, but the best way is to take into

    the past environment in a more realistic way.

    Making Under Risk” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1977). Loss aversion could
    lead to decreased risk taking and therefore decreased expected return. However,
    the most significant effect is on the stop levels. Loss-averse humans do not want
    to accept that they are losing money and will see a losing position as an ongoing
    position and, therefore, prefer to wait until it turns positive. This is highly
    dangerous, as leaving positions without stop-loss levels could lead to disastrous
    results. In addition, some people close out of winning positions too quickly in
    fear that they will turn negative (a form of fear of regret). The best way to
