- en: This book tries to show how ML and deep learning models can be incorporated
    to address financial problems. This, of course, does not mean that the book includes
    all models with all necessary steps required to deploy models in the industry,
    but I have tried to focus on the topics I felt would be of the greatest interest
    to the reader.

- en: Recent developments in AI indicate that almost all traditional financial models
    are outperformed by AI models in terms of predictive performance, and I believe
    that adopting these models and having improved predictive performance in the industry
    will help finance practitioners make better decisions.

- en: However, despite these developments and recent hype around AI, the deployment
    level of AI models is not even close to where it should be. The opaque nature
    of these models stands out as the first and foremost reason. However, there are
    constant and tremendous improvements toward getting more explainable AI models,
    and these orchestrated efforts have started to pay off, as Prado has argued, whether
    ML is opaque or not depends on the person using it, not on the ML algorithms themselves.

    resistance to paradigm shift are the primary reasons for the slow and reluctant
    adoption of AI models.

    and convenient transition to using them.
