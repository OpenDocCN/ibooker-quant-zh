    the sense that the intelligence is not displayed by a biological organism but
    rather by a machine, and *intelligence* as defined by AI researcher Max Tegmark
    as the “ability to accomplish complex goals.” This part introduces central notions
    and algorithms from the AI field, gives examples of major recent breakthroughs,
