<span class="keep-together">The Landscape</span></h1>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Machine learning promises to shake up large swathes of finance</em></p>
<p data-type="attribution">The Economist (2017)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a new wave of machine learning and data science in finance, and the related applications will transform the industry over the next few decades.</p>

<p>Currently, most financial firms, including hedge funds, investment and retail banks, and fintech firms, are adopting and investing heavily in machine learning. Going forward, financial institutions will need a growing number of machine learning and data science experts.</p>

<p>Machine learning in finance has become more prominent recently due to the
availability of vast amounts of data and more affordable computing power. The use of data science and machine learning
is exploding exponentially across all areas of finance.</p>

<p>The success of machine learning in finance depends upon building efficient infrastructure, using the correct toolkit, and applying the right algorithms. The concepts related to these building blocks of machine learning in finance are demonstrated and utilized throughout this book.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the current and future application of machine learning in finance, including a brief overview of different types of machine learning. This chapter and the two that follow serve as the foundation for the case studies presented in the rest of the book.</p>

<h1>Current and Future Machine Learning Applications 
<span class="keep-together">in Finance</span></h1>

<p>Let’s take a look at some promising machine learning applications in finance. The case studies presented in this book cover all the applications mentioned here.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Algorithmic Trading"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935423016">
<h2>Algorithmic Trading</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithmic trading" id="idm45174935510712"/><em>Algorithmic trading</em> (or simply <em>algo trading</em>) is the use of algorithms to conduct trades autonomously.
With origins going back to the 1970s, algorithmic trading (sometimes called Automated Trading Systems, which is arguably a more accurate description) involves the use of automated preprogrammed trading instructions to make extremely fast, objective trading decisions.</p>

<p>Machine learning stands to push algorithmic trading to new levels. Not only can more advanced strategies be employed and adapted in real time, but machine learning–based techniques can offer even more avenues for gaining special insight into market movements. Most hedge funds and financial institutions do not openly disclose their machine learning–based approaches to trading (for good reason), but machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in calibrating trading decisions in real time.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Portfolio Management and Robo-Advisors"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935507640">
<h2>Portfolio Management and Robo-Advisors</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="portfolio management" data-secondary="robo-advisors and" id="idm45174935506184"/>Asset and wealth management firms are exploring potential artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for improving their investment decisions and making use of their troves of historical data.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="robo-advisors" data-seealso="risk tolerance and robo-advisor case study" id="idm45174935504616"/>One example of this is the use of <em>robo-advisors</em>, algorithms built to calibrate a financial portfolio to the goals and risk tolerance of the user. Additionally, they provide automated financial guidance and service to end investors and clients.</p>

<p>A user enters their financial goals (e.g., to retire at age 65 with $250,000 in savings), age, income, and current financial assets. The advisor (the <em>allocator</em>) then spreads investments across asset classes and financial instruments in order to reach the user’s goals.</p>

<p>The system then calibrates to changes in the user’s goals and real-time changes in the market, aiming always to find the best fit for the user’s original goals. Robo-advisors have gained significant traction among consumers who do not need a human advisor to feel comfortable investing.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Fraud Detection"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174934968968">
<h2>Fraud Detection</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fraud detection" id="idm45174934967880"/>Fraud is a massive problem for financial institutions and one of the foremost reasons to leverage machine learning in finance.</p>

<p>There is currently a significant data security risk due to high computing power, frequent internet use, and an increasing amount of company data being stored online. While previous financial fraud detection systems depended heavily on complex and robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist of risk factors—it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or real) security threats.</p>

<p>Machine learning is ideally suited to combating fraudulent financial transactions.
This is because machine learning systems can scan through vast datasets, detect unusual activities, and flag them instantly. Given the incalculably high number of ways that security can be breached, genuine machine learning systems will be an absolute necessity in the days to come.</p>

<p>Especially at large companies (big banks and publicly traded insurance firms), machine learning algorithms can be trained on millions of examples of consumer data and financial lending or insurance outcomes, such as whether a person defaulted on their loan or mortgage.</p>

<p>Underlying financial trends can be assessed with algorithms and continuously analyzed to detect trends that might influence lending and underwriting risk in the future. Algorithms can perform automated tasks such as matching data records, identifying exceptions, and calculating whether an applicant qualifies for a credit or insurance product.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Automation and Chatbots"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935452872">
<h2>Automation and Chatbots</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="automation, finance and" id="idm45174935451432"/>Automation is patently well suited to finance. It reduces the strain that repetitive, low-value tasks put on human employees. It tackles the routine, everyday processes, freeing up teams to finish their high-value work. In doing so, it drives enormous time and cost savings.</p>

<p>Adding machine learning and AI into the automation mix adds another level of support for employees. With access to relevant data, machine learning and AI can provide an in-depth data analysis to support finance teams with difficult decisions. In some cases, it may even be able to recommend the best course of action for employees to approve and enact.</p>

<p>AI and automation in the financial sector can also learn to recognize errors, reducing the time wasted between discovery and resolution. This means that human team members are less likely to be delayed in providing their reports and are able to complete their work with fewer errors.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chatbots" id="idm45174934955288"/>AI chatbots can be implemented to support finance and banking customers. With the rise in popularity of live chat software in banking and finance businesses, chatbots are the natural evolution.</p>

<h2>Risk Management</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="risk management" id="idm45174934953064"/>Machine learning techniques are transforming how we approach risk management. All aspects of understanding and controlling risk are being revolutionized through the growth of solutions driven by machine learning. Examples range from deciding how much a bank should lend a customer to improving compliance and reducing model risk.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Asset Price Prediction"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174934951624">
<h2>Asset Price Prediction</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="asset price prediction" id="idm45174934950456"/>Asset price prediction is considered the most frequently discussed and most sophisticated area in finance. Predicting asset prices allows one to understand the factors that drive the market and speculate asset performance. Traditionally, asset price prediction was performed by analyzing past financial reports and market performance to determine what position to take for a specific security or asset class. However, with 
<span class="keep-together">a tremendous</span> increase in the amount of financial data, the traditional approaches for analysis and stock-selection strategies are being supplemented with ML-based 
<span class="keep-together">techniques.</span></p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Derivative Pricing"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935394600">
<h2>Derivative Pricing</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derivative pricing" id="idm45174935393400"/>Recent machine learning successes, as well as the fast pace of innovation, indicate that ML applications for derivatives pricing should become widely used in the coming years. The world of Black-Scholes models, volatility smiles, and Excel spreadsheet models should wane as more advanced methods become readily available.</p>

<p>The classic derivative pricing models are built on several impractical assumptions to reproduce the empirical relationship between the underlying input data (strike price, time to maturity, option type) and the price of the derivatives observed in the market. Machine learning methods do not rely on several assumptions; they just try to estimate a function between the input data and price, minimizing the difference between the results of the model and the target.</p>

<p>The faster deployment times achieved with state-of-the-art ML tools are just one of the advantages that will accelerate the use of machine learning in derivatives pricing.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Sentiment Analysis"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935390504">
<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sentiment analysis" id="idm45174935389304"/>Sentiment analysis involves the perusal of enormous volumes of unstructured data, such as videos, transcriptions, photos, audio files, social media posts, articles, and business documents, to determine market sentiment. Sentiment analysis is crucial for all businesses in today’s workplace and is an excellent example of machine learning in finance.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="financial news, sentiment analysis of" id="idm45174935387848"/>The most common use of sentiment analysis in the financial sector is the analysis of financial news—in particular, predicting the behaviors and possible trends of markets. The stock market moves in response to myriad human-related factors, and the hope is that machine learning will be able to replicate and enhance human intuition about financial activity by discovering new trends and telling signals.</p>

<p>However, much of the future applications of machine learning will be in understanding social media, news trends, and other data sources related to predicting the sentiments of customers toward market developments. It will not be limited to predicting stock prices and trades.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Trade Settlement"><div class="sect2" id="idm45174935597880">
<h2>Trade Settlement</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="trade settlement" id="idm45174935596680"/>Trade settlement is the process of transferring securities into the account of a buyer and cash into the seller’s account following a transaction of a financial asset.</p>

<p>Despite the majority of trades being settled automatically, and with little or no interaction by human beings, about 30% of trades need to be settled manually.</p>

<p>The use of machine learning not only can identify the reason for failed trades, but it also can analyze why the trades were rejected, provide a solution, and predict which trades may fail in the future. What usually would take a human being five to ten minutes to fix, machine learning can do in a fraction of a second.</p>

<h1>Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science</h1>

<p>For the majority of people, the terms <em>machine learning</em>, <em>deep learning</em>, <em>artificial intelligence</em>, and <em>data science</em> are confusing. In fact, a lot of people use one term interchangeably with the others.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#AI_ML_DL_DS">Figure 1-1</a> shows the relationships between AI, machine learning, deep learning and data science. Machine learning is a subset of AI that consists of techniques that enable computers to identify patterns in data and to deliver AI applications. Deep learning, meanwhile, is a subset of machine learning that enables computers to solve more complex problems.</p>

<p>Data science isn’t exactly a subset of machine learning, but it uses machine learning, deep learning, and AI to analyze data and reach actionable conclusions. It combines machine learning, deep learning and AI with other disciplines such as big data analytics and cloud computing.</p>

<h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="reinforcement learning (RL)" data-secondary="defined" id="idm45174935615816"/>Learning from experiences, and the associated rewards or punishments, is the core concept behind <em>reinforcement learning</em> (RL). It is about taking suitable actions to maximize reward in a particular situation. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="agent (RL system)" data-secondary="definition" id="idm45174935614040"/>The learning system, called an <em>agent</em>, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and receive rewards (or penalties in the form of negative rewards) in return, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#RL">Figure 1-6</a>.</p>

<p>Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in this way: In supervised learning, the training data has the answer key, so the model is trained with the correct answers available. In reinforcement learning, there is no explicit answer. The learning system (agent) decides what to do to perform the given task and learns whether that was a correct action based on the reward. The algorithm determines the answer key through its experience.</p>

<p>The steps of the reinforcement learning are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, the agent interacts with the environment by performing an action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the agent receives a reward based on the action it performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the reward, the agent receives an observation and understands whether the action was good or bad. If the action was good—that is, if the agent received a positive reward—then the agent will prefer performing that action. If the reward was less favorable, the agent will try performing another action to  receive a positive reward. It is basically a trial-and-error learning process.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_Chapter1-asciidoc0" id="idm45174934937928"/></p>
