    coding and automated research have become integral parts of the trading world.
    Anyone who masters the art of trading and coding has a tremendous edge in the
    markets.

- en: Trading techniques are numerous, and they can be based on many tools and concepts.
    For example, fundamental traders rely on economic and political analyses to derive
    a long-term view on different assets, while technical traders rely on more quantitative
    measures and a few psychological concepts to forecast the next likely moves of
    the markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we can say that on a high level there exist two types of analyses,
    fundamental and technical. This book will present in detail a field in technical
    analysis called *candlestick pattern recognition*.

- en: 'I have spent my career researching trading strategies, patterns, and anything
    related to the financial world. I have developed a special passion for patterns,
    and specifically candlestick patterns, due to their widespread adoption but also
    their interesting performance results. Moreover, throughout the years, I have
    discovered a few candlestick patterns that I believe can at least rival the classical
    patterns. This brings us to the purpose of writing the book: I am aiming to present
    the totality of candlestick patterns, including my personal ones, and how to code
    a system that back-tests them across a wide variety of markets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machines can perform pattern recognition and detection better than humans because
    of their objectivity. Therefore, I have dedicated the first chapters of the book
    to creating the structure of a candlestick pattern recognition algorithm before
    moving on to dig deep into patterns and strategies in the later chapters. This
    means that the first skill you will learn is how to automate the data import process
    in Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many classical candlestick patterns, and it is everyone’s duty to
    test them to see whether they actually are predictive. After all, if we use these
    patterns to forecast the markets, we should have objective results that prove
    they are indeed value-adders. We will get such results and interpret them, just
    as I do with the candlestick patterns that I have discovered over the years. We
    will also see the advantages and limitations of every pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we do find the good patterns that help with the predictive task, you should
    insert them in the overall trading framework, which includes other tools and a
    risk management system. You will learn how to code technical indicators and combine
    them with candlestick patterns to create trading signals. Finally, you will back-test
    these signals, and you will be able to optimize the parameters so that you get
    a good full-scale pattern recognition strategy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, the utility of this book is to show you how to automate your research
    by letting the algorithms you create evaluate the different candlestick patterns.
    Finally, you will learn how to determine your strategy, which will use the patterns
    and combine with other technical indicators.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is suited to aspiring students, academics, curious minds, and finance
    practitioners who are interested in candlestick pattern recognition and its applications
    in finance. You will benefit from this book if you are interested not only in
    using Python but also in developing strategies and technical indicators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book assumes you have basic background knowledge in both Python programming
    (professional Python users will find the code very straightforward) and financial
    trading. I take a clear and simple approach that focuses on the key concepts so
    that you understand the purpose of every idea.
