<p>This technique<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="symmetrical exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_symm_exit"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="exit techniques" data-secondary="symmetrical exit" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_exit_symm"/> gives an easy target for any candlestick pattern based on the size of a key candlestick inside the pattern. The <em>symmetrical exit</em> takes the distance of the high and low of the key candlestick and projects it from one of the extremities (depending on whether it is a bullish or bearish pattern).</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>The <em>key candlestick</em> is the one used<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="key candlestick" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853239152"/> to determine the symmetrical target. Generally, it is the candlestick that either confirms the pattern or defines it. For instance, the key candlestick of a Doji pattern is the middle candlestick that resembles a plus sign, while the key candlestick of a Euphoria pattern is the third (and biggest) <span class="keep-together">candlestick</span>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The Fixed Holding Period Exit Technique" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46762853245600">
<h1>The Fixed Holding Period Exit Technique</h1>
<p>The fixed<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="exit techniques" data-secondary="fixed holding period exit" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853207168"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fixed holding period exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853205952"/> holding period assumes that you must exit a pattern after a prespecified number of time periods. It is a relatively inflexible technique and assumes that the reaction must happen within a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The main idea is that when a position is initiated after the validation of a candlestick pattern, a time counter begins and runs until the exit, regardless of the market price relative to the entry price.</p>
<p>For example, a bullish Tweezers pattern is validated, and a position is initiated. Following a fixed holding period of 5, the position must be exited after five time periods. The fixed holding period technique assumes a time-dependent pattern, which is valid for a prespecified window.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="The Variable Holding Period Exit Technique" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46762853203376">
<h1>The Variable Holding Period Exit Technique</h1>
<p>The variable<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="exit techniques" data-secondary="variable holding period exit" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853201888"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="variable holding period exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853200672"/> holding period assumes that you must exit a pattern after encountering another pattern. It is a relatively inflexible technique.</p>
<p>The main idea is that when a position is initiated after the validation of a candlestick pattern, you exit it only if you encounter another pattern, whether bullish or bearish. This means that the pattern is valid until the market shows you otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, a bearish Harami pattern is validated, and a position is initiated. Following a variable holding period, the position is exited only if another pattern is encountered.</p>
<p>This technique can be dangerous with rare patterns as the position can remain open for extended periods of time, thus rendering the trades obsolete and meaningless.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>This technique assumes that you exit only when you encounter the same type of pattern or any type of other pattern (bullish or bearish). It is worth mentioning that this is the technique used in the back-tests presented throughout the book.</p>

<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="The Hybrid Exit Technique" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46762853197008">
<h1 class="less_space">The Hybrid Exit Technique</h1>
<p>The hybrid<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid holding period exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853194960"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="exit techniques" data-secondary="hybrid holding period exit" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853193984"/> exit technique is probably the best choice among the discussed exit techniques as it combines the attributes of the three exit techniques so as to limit the risks. The hybrid exit technique uses a first-come, first-served method to determine the exit of a candlestick pattern using the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The symmetrical<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="symmetrical exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853191680"/> projection is calculated and is given a certain weight between 1% and 99%.</li>
<li>The variable holding period is monitored for every candlestick and is also given a certain weight, which is the remainder of the first given weight.</li>
<li>The fixed<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fixed holding period exit technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853189648"/> holding period is used to frame the whole trade in a maximum duration scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the preceding bullet points mean is that you will be exiting the pattern on two occasions, whichever comes first (symmetrical projection or appearance of another pattern). When you exit a position, you have a certain weight, for example 50%. This means that you will exit 50% of the position upon validating the symmetrical projection or the appearance of another pattern.</p>
<p>If you do not meet these two conditions before a prespecified time window elapses, the position is closed (the fixed holding period enters).</p>
<p>Let’s try an example. Suppose the market has validated a bullish Mirror pattern on EURUSD with the following trade details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate the buy order at $1.0000.</li>
<li>The calculation of the symmetrical projection gives a target at $1.0100.</li>
<li>The weighting is set at 50%.</li>
<li>The fixed holding period is set at five periods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a hypothetical time line that shows how the trade could go if the trader uses the hybrid approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>H-1</em>: The market reaches a high of $1.0110; half the trade is closed because the pattern reached its symmetrical projection.</li>
<li><em>H-2</em>: The market trades and closes at $1.0000.</li>
<li><em>H-3</em>: The market trades and closes at $0.9995.</li>
<li><em>H-4</em>: The market trades and closes at $1.0150.</li>
<li><em>H-5</em>: The market closes at $1.0120, and no pattern has emerged during the five periods. The remainder of the position is liquidated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each market may have a unique exit approach that works well on it. Generally, the hybrid technique tries to get the best of all worlds by incorporating multiple exit techniques. <a data-type="xref" href="#table9-1">Table 9-1</a> shows the key differences among the discussed exit techniques.</p>

In such instances, you must be ready to limit the damage, which is done by creating <em>invalidation rules</em>. These rules, depending on the trader, can be objective or subjective.</p>
<p>Patterns<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="and invalidation rules" data-secondary-sortas="invalidation rules" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853163136"/> can be invalidated by risk management techniques such as stop-losses that are fixed by traders themselves or by volatility measures such as the ATR, which I previously discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#chapter5">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Note that pattern invalidation is similar to an exit technique except it deals with exiting at a loss. However, the fixed holding period technique can be seen as both a target or an invalidation technique due to it being a risk-limiting approach (exiting after a certain amount of time) and a target approach (exiting after believing that the pattern could cause a reaction for a limited period of time).</p>
</div>
<p>Pattern invalidation can be twofold:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fixed stop-losses</dt>
<dd>This invalidation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stop-loss point" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853158272"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fixed stop-losses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853157296"/> method limits risk by imposing a fixed level that liquidates the position if the market reaches it. This method is not recommended as the volatility of the market changes all the time.</dd>
<dt>ATR-based stop-losses</dt>
<dd>This invalidation<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="volatility" data-secondary="ATR indicator" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853155424"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ATR-based stop-losses" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853154208"/> method limits risk by imposing a level based on the values of the ATR. It is recommended to weight the risk according to volatility.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, a trader can always use 20 pips as a stop-loss for their EURUSD short-term trades. This means that if a pattern emerges and a buy order is initiated at $1.0000, whenever the market touches or breaks $0.9980, the position is automatically liquidated at a loss. In contrast, if the same trader uses the ATR-based technique to invalidate the pattern, they would exit if the market breaks the open price minus the ATR reading at initiation multiplied by a constant<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_candle_chart_exit" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853152448"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix__exit_tech_ch9" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762853151232"/> such as 2.</p>
<p>To be clearer, suppose that the ATR has a value of 20. Then, the stop-loss would be at $0.9960 (20 × 2 = 40).</p>
