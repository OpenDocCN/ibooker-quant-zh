    generated by other investments like stocks.

    experience higher revenues and sales. This boost in earnings can drive stock prices
    higher, as investors expect better returns from companies. It also results in
    higher consumer spending. This can benefit companies that rely heavily on consumer
    purchases, such as retail and consumer goods companies, which may experience increased
    sales and profitability. Additionally, a strong economy instills confidence in
    investors, leading them to be more willing to take on risk and invest in the stock
    market (as opposed to the fixed income market). Positive sentiment can attract
    more buyers, leading to a rise in stock prices (which may also attract speculative
    traders who will push prices even higher). It is also possible that central banks
    may implement policies to effectively control inflation, which can be positive
    for stocks. Moderate inflation rates and low interest rates can encourage borrowing,
    investment, and business expansion.

    overheating and control inflation. Rising interest rates lead to higher yields
    on new bonds, making existing bonds with lower yields less attractive. As a result,
    bond prices may decline, especially for long-term bonds. Additionally, when the
    economy is strong and businesses are performing well, investors may prefer to
    allocate more of their funds to the potentially higher returns offered by the
    stock market rather than fixed income investments. The same reasoning applies
    to the fact that there will be lower demand for safe haven assets such as government
    bonds as investors are more confident about the overall economic outlook. Consequently,
    demand for such bonds may decrease, putting downward pressure on prices.

    consumer spending. As a result, the demand for commodities, especially industrial
    metals like copper and steel, tends to rise due to their use in manufacturing
    and construction. Economic growth also leads to higher energy consumption. Therefore,
    oil and natural gas demand often increases, pushing their prices upward. Rising
    inflation expectations is a result of a growing economy, and this may lead investors
    to turn to precious metals (such as gold and silver) as a hedge against currency
    devaluation and market uncertainties. Finally, agricultural commodities (such
    as wheat and corn) may also witness a rise due to increased consumer spending
    on food products.

    the domestic currency. International investors seek higher returns in a strong
    economy, leading to increased demand for assets denominated in that currency.
    As demand for the domestic currency rises, its value appreciates relative to other
    currencies in the foreign exchange market. Central banks may raise interest rates
    to manage the rising inflation and ensure economic stability. Higher interest
    rates attract foreign investors seeking better returns, driving up demand for
    the domestic currency and pushing its value higher. Similarly, a strong economy
    often leads to increased exports, as domestic goods and services become more competitive
    globally. This can improve the country’s trade balance and contribute to a stronger
    currency.

    money to the central bank on an overnight basis. This rate is crucial because
    it influences various other interest rates in the economy, including those charged
