    to worry about timing the market and just riding it, but the reality is that doing
    so can be challenging due to a plethora of random variables impacting the price.
    A steadily rising market may get destabilized by one economic or political event
    but then continue to move smoothly, discombobulating the traders who got stopped
    out during the volatility tsunami.'

- en: This chapter covers the classic (already known and established in the world
    of technical analysis) trend-following candlestick patterns. These are simple
    and complex configurations that have been around since the dawn of technical analysis
    and are taught in many introductory and advanced technical analysis courses. The
    purpose of this chapter is to create the patterns’ objective conditions and back-test
    them so that you can form a basic opinion about their frequency and predictability.
    Some patterns may occur quite often, while others occur once in a blue moon, thus
    hindering the ability to properly judge them.

    I initiate the buy or sell position upon the next open after having validated
    the signal on the previous close. The time frame chosen for the back-tests in
    this book is hourly.

- en: It is relatively easy to distinguish between Marubozu candlesticks and normal
    candlesticks because Marubozu candlesticks do not have any wicks. This means that
    a bullish Marubozu candlestick has the same open and low price as well as the
    same close and high price. In contrast, a bearish Marubozu candlestick has the
    same open and high price as well as the same close and low price. [Figure 4-1](#figure4-1)
    shows these two versions of a Marubozu candlestick.

- en: When the market is in a strong uptrend, it rarely makes lower lows and generally
    closes around the highs due to the sheer force of demand for the underlying security.
    The maximum force of demand in one candlestick is demonstrated by the absence
    of a low and by a close at the high, and this is precisely what the bullish Marubozu
    is all about. When an asset closes at the high price, you get the signal that
    the buyers are hungry for more, and when no low is lower than the open price,
    you should have further conviction that there is no interest in selling since
    no one has managed to push the price lower than its opening.

- en: Similarly, when the market is in a strong downtrend, it rarely makes higher
    highs and generally closes around the lows due to the overwhelming force of supply
    for the underlying security. The maximum force of supply in one candlestick is
    demonstrated by the absence of a high and a close at the low, as demonstrated
    by the bearish Marubozu.

    a few decimal points because of the probability of occurrence. For instance, in
    the currencies market, if you use five decimals on EURUSD, you are likely to not
    find any Marubozu patterns anytime soon, but when you stick to the usual, less-accurate
    convention of four decimals (see [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter2)), you start
    seeing the pattern more often. This holds true for all markets; therefore, to
    be able to analyze this pattern, you need to make a small tweak with regard to
    decimals.

- en: A bearish Tasuki pattern (see [Figure 4-11](#figure4-11)) is the mirror image
    of the bullish Tasuki. It is composed of three candlesticks where the first one
    is a bearish candlestick, the second one is another bearish candlestick that gaps
    under the first candlestick, and the third candlestick is bullish but does not
    close above the close of the first candlestick.

    a certain threshold, be it support or resistance, should have a gravitational

    does not quite close the gap, it may be a signal that the sellers are not strong
    enough to take the lead, giving a bullish bias. Similarly, whenever you see a
    market gapping down followed by a bullish candlestick that does not quite close
    the gap, it may be a signal that the buyers are not strong enough to take the
    lead, giving a bearish bias.

- en: The *Three Methods* pattern is a complex configuration mainly composed of five
    candlesticks. The rising Three Methods pattern should occur in a bullish trend
    with the first candlestick being a big-bodied bullish one followed by three small-bodied
    bearish candlesticks typically contained within the range of the first candlestick.
    To confirm the pattern, one last big bullish candlestick must be printed with
    a close higher than the first candlestick’s high. This is just like a bullish
    breakout of a small consolidation.

- en: Psychologically speaking, the pattern relates to the concept of surpass or break
    as a confirmation of the initial move. Traders generally push the prices up until
    they begin to book their profits and thus close out of the positions. This activity
    has a smoothing effect on the price and should stabilize it through a phase called
    *correction* or *consolidation*.

    refers to an actual trap. The pattern is complex, being composed of around five
    candlesticks depending on the literature (some research shows that it could be
    a combination of multiple candlesticks but does not specify the number of candlesticks).'
  prefs: []

    candlestick followed by a bearish candlestick completely embedded inside the first
    one. Then, two candlesticks must appear with a high that does not surpass the
    second candle’s high. Finally, a big bullish candlestick appears with a close
    that surpasses the high of the second candlestick. This serves as the validation
    of the pattern and the upside confirmation.

    in nature. The term *entrapment* comes from the fact that a bullish Hikkake is
    historically a bearish trap for traders thinking that the market has seen a resistance
    and should continue lower. Therefore, whenever you see the final candlestick breaching
    the highs and validating the configuration, you can have a certain confidence
    that more strength is to come. This is because stops are getting taken out and
    because traders are looking at a market that is surpassing its resistance, which
    is theoretically a strong bullish signal.
