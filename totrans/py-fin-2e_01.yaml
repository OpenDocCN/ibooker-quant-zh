    The same holds true for the wealth of libraries and packages that can be installed
    optionally. First of all, there is not only *one* Python. Python comes in many
    different flavors, like CPython, Jython, IronPython or PyPy. Then there is still
    the divide between Python 2.7 and the 3.x world.^([1](ch02.html#idm140277702866800))
    In what follows, the chapter focuses on *CPython*, the by far most popular version
    of the Python programming language, and here on *version 3.6*.

    cloud instance. There are many other cloud providers out there, among them [Amazon
    Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) as the leading provider. However, DigitalOcean
    is well known for its simplicity and also its relatively low rates for their smaller
    cloud instances, which they call *droplet*. The smallest droplet, which is generally
    sufficient for exploration and development purposes, only costs 5 USD per month
    or 0.007 USD per hour. Users get only charged by the hour so that you can easily
    spin up a droplet for 2 hours, destroy it afterwards and get charged just 0.014
    USD. If you do not have an account yet, register for one on this [sign-up page](https://m.do.co/c/fbe512dd3dac)

    needed. In general, one would expect that such a certificate comes from a so-called

    certificate is "`good enough`“.^([6](ch02.html#idm140277702285376)) A popular

    book. However, Python deployment can be tricky at best and sometimes even tedious
    and nerve wrecking. Fortunately, technologies are available today — all younger
    than five years — that help with the deployment issue. The open source software
    `conda` helps with both Python package and virtual environment management. Docker
    containers go even further in that complete file systems and runtime environments
    can be easily created in a technically shielded "`sandbox`“, i.e. the container.
    Going even one step further, cloud providers like DigitalOcean offer compute and
    storage capacity in professionally managed and secured data centers within minutes
    and billed by the hour. This in combination with a Python 3.6 installation and
    a secured Jupyter Notebook server installation provides a professional environment
    for Python development and deployment in the context of algorithmic trading projects.
