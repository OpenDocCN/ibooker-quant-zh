    of riding an existing trend in the expectation that it persists. It is time to
    see the contrarian patterns that signal a reversal or at least a correction in
    the initial move. Therefore, contrarian patterns suggest a strategy of fading
    the trend as opposed to riding it.

    I mean the patterns that are already known and established in the world of technical
    analysis. The purpose of this chapter is to create the contrarian patterns’ objective
    conditions and back-test them so that you can form an opinion about their frequency
    and predictability.

    as it is the most known and intuitive configuration. The word *doji* means “mistake”
    in Japanese, and this is logical as traders label it as an indecision pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like the Marubozu pattern, the *Doji* pattern is a one-candle configuration
    where the open price equals the close price. This is why Doji is an indecision
    pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To distinguish a bullish Doji from a bearish one, you have to check the previous
    candlestick as well as the one after it. [Figure 6-1](#figure6-1) shows the theoretical
    bullish Doji configuration. In a falling market, the apparition of an indecision
    candle such as the Doji can be a first clue to a change of direction. It must
    be confirmed by a subsequent bullish candle.

    When there are more buyers than sellers, the balance of power  is tilted upward
    as demand is greater than supply; thus, the market rises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When demand starts losing momentum and approaches the supply level, an equilibrium
    occurs as evidenced by the loss of momentum in shaping new highs. An *equilibrium*
    occurs when a Doji pattern appears as a close price that equals an open price,
    showing that neither party has successfully pushed the price toward its desired
    direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, when supply is increasing relative to demand, the market should
    start dropping. The Doji pattern shapes the equilibrium point where the market
    switches from bullish to an expected bearish regime.

    means that it is a Doji where only the low price is different from the others.
    It is also an indecision pattern that can be either bullish or bearish depending
    on the prior price action. The issue with this pattern is that you can think of
    it in two ways: either the market has not made a higher high, thus failing to
    continue higher and giving a bearish bias, or the market failed to close lower
    and went back up to square one, giving a bullish bias. In any case, it must be
    treated as all Doji patterns are treated: as a reversal pattern.'

    see more than one successive Doji pattern. Two successive Doji patterns signify
    prolonged indecision, and it is possible that the reversal’s conviction is lowered
    as the contrarian traders are still hesitating and struggling to force the market
    their way. Generally, two Doji patterns are not worth more than one Doji.

    to define the current market regime before relying on a Doji pattern for a future
    reaction. For example, in a bullish trending market, the bearish Doji pattern
    is unlikely to provide a signal of quality, but in a sideways market, the efficacy
    increases (remember the invisible hand).

    is a classic contrarian two-candle configuration where the body of the second
    candle is englobed by the body of the first candle. There are generally two types
    of Harami patterns, the strict one and the flexible one, and I discuss both in
    this chapter. Let’s start with the flexible version.

    bullish candle (the baby), which has its close price lower than the open price
    of the first candle and its open price higher than the close price of the first
    candle. The highs and lows of both candles are not relevant in the flexible version
    and are discussed in the strict version instead. [Figure 6-10](#figure6-10) illustrates

    candle size signals hesitation in the initial trend and that a reversal may be
    imminent. Generally, with classic patterns, there may be an aspect of self-fulfilling
    prophecy where a certain percentage of the predictability is due to the reputation
    of the pattern as opposed to its intuitive explanation.

    pattern is composed of a first bearish candlestick and a second bullish candlestick
    that shares the same low as the first candlestick. [Figure 6-20](#figure6-20)

- en: This is not really a tradable pattern because it is extremely rare. I am covering
    it for educational purposes only as you should not expect to see much of it in
    practice. The *Abandoned Baby* is a three-candle configuration where the middle
    candlestick is a Doji. The bullish Abandoned Baby is composed of a bearish candle
    followed by a Doji candlestick that gaps lower and has a high that does not touch
    the low of the first candlestick. Finally, it has a third bullish candlestick,
    also with a low that does not touch the high of the middle candlestick. [Figure 6-43](#figure6-43)
    illustrates a bullish Abandoned Baby pattern.

    rendering the Abandoned Baby a beautiful mythological configuration that underperforms

    pattern, albeit it is less powerful because the close price does not exactly equal
    the open price. However, the volatility stemming from the long wicks shows the
    battle between buyers and sellers and may signal that a clear direction should
    appear after the pattern.

    of power before the third candle confirms this new move by surpassing the close
    of the second candle. The second candle’s containment within the body of the first
    one signals that the sellers could not push the price lower—a sign that they are
    starting to struggle. The intuition behind the Inside Down pattern is that after
