<h1><span class="label">Chapter 12. </span>Risk Management and Trading Psychology</h1>
<p><em>Risk management </em>is one<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_risk_man_ch12"/> of the pillars of any trading system, and in fact it may be the most important pillar. Finding a predictive and profitable trading strategy is what will make you money, but a sound risk management system is what will allow you to <span class="keep-together">keep it.</span></p>
<p>This chapter discusses the subjective part of the trading process and explains the known biases that you may encounter when trading.</p>

<h1>Basics of Risk Management</h1>
<p>Risk management does not have to be complex. You can create a solid risk management system by using the few simple rules given in this section.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Stops and Targets" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46762847971728">
<h2>Stops and Targets</h2>
<p>As previously<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stop-loss order" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847970176"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="take-profit order" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847684864"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="target price" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847683760"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="stops and targets" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847682656"/> discussed in the book, a <em>stop-loss order</em> is an automatic order set during the trade initiation to ensure a minimal predetermined loss. For example, if you buy a few contracts on gold at $1,500 in anticipation that it will go to $2,000, you may place your stop-loss order at $1,250 so that if the price drops to $1,250, you limit your losses to no more than $250. At the same time, your anticipation of selling when the market price reaches $2,000 is known as a <em>take-profit order</em> (<em>target</em>).</p>
<p>The most basic risk management system for any trade is setting proper stops and targets so that you are framing your expectations and limiting your risks.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>One rule that you must never violate: always place stops and <span class="keep-together">targets</span>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Trailing Stops" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46762848111984">
<h2>Trailing Stops</h2>
<p>A <em>trailing stop</em> is a dynamic<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trend-following strategies" data-secondary="trailing stops with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847263504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="trailing stops" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847262128"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stop-loss order" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846292288"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trailing stop order" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846291184"/> stop-loss order that follows the market price whenever it goes in the expected direction, thus ensuring less loss and at some point in time ensuring a no-loss trade. The best way to understand the trailing stop order is through an example. Suppose you go long on EURUSD at $1.0000 to target $1.0500. You set your stop-loss order at $0.9900 to limit your losses. Now suppose two days have passed and the current market price is at $1.0230 and you want to ensure your trade never loses money. The solution to this is a trailing stop order where you move your stop from $0.9900 to $1.0000 so that, in the worst case, when the market drops back to $1.0000, you close out and break even. Another way of ensuring at least some profit is to move the stop to $1.0100, thus ensuring a profitable trade no matter what. Of course, the closer you move your stop to the current market price, the more likely you are to be stopped out (of profitably in this case).</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>It is always a good idea to use trailing stops with trend-following strategies.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Position Sizing" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46762846288560">
<h2>Position Sizing</h2>
<p><em>Position sizing</em> is the choice<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="risk management" data-secondary="position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_risk_position_size"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="sizing of positions" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_size_position"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_position_size"/> of the number of contracts or lots to allocate for each trade. Some traders use the same size for all their trades, while others prefer to weight them differently depending on one or more factors. There are many ways of sizing your positions, and some use historical data, which takes into account your previous results to optimize the size. The following is a list of the techniques:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fixed amount</dt>
<dd>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="fixed amount technique, position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847764992"/> is the simplest sizing technique as it does not require any effort. For example, you do not need to choose the number of contracts or how much money to allocate to trades. For example, you can invest $1,000 in each trade regardless of your capital or of the risk. This may be considered a simplistic technique, but some traders prefer to direct their efforts elsewhere and leave position sizing neutral.</dd>
<dt>Percentage of portfolio</dt>
<dd>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="percentage of portfolio technique, position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847373680"/> technique is a more dynamic version of the fixed-amount technique as the positions the trader takes grow and shrink since they are pegged to the portfolio’s size. For example, you have a 3% position size rule. If your portfolio is $100,000, then you should take $3,000 trades. If the market value of the portfolio changes to $120,000, then you should take $3,600 trades.</dd>
<dt>Conviction-wise</dt>
<dd>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="conviction-wise technique, position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847371584"/> is a subjective technique of sizing positions that is based on the degree of conviction of the trader. For example, if you have more faith in buying EURUSD than in buying Microsoft stocks, then you might allocate more money into the EURUSD trade. The difference in amounts depends on you.</dd>
<dt>Kelly criterion</dt>
<dd>This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kelly criterion technique, position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847348272"/> is an objective mathematical formula that tells you how much to invest by using your historical results. Created by John Kelly, the formula is mainly used in horse betting, but it is also used in trading. The formula is as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<div data-type="equation">
<math alttext="Kelly weight equals upper W minus StartFraction left-parenthesis 1 minus upper W right-parenthesis Over upper R EndFraction">
<mrow>
<mtext>Kelly</mtext>
<mspace width="4.pt"/>

<mo>-</mo>
<mfrac><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>W</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow> <mi>R</mi></mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</div>
<p>Here, <em>Kelly weight</em> is the percentage<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kelly weight" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847691328"/> size of the trade you should take with regard to your portfolio’s overall value, <em>W</em> is the historical hit ratio, and <em>R</em> is the ratio between the average gain and the average loss. See the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical hit ratio of the past 100 trades = 56%</li>
<li>Historical loss ratio of the past 100 trades = 44%</li>
<li>Average gain per trade = $110</li>
<li>Average loss per trade = $100</li>
<li>Win-to-loss ratio = 1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the recommended trade allocation if you find an opportunity?</p>
<p>By using the formula, the answer is 16%. Naturally, the Kelly criterion is not a perfect measure as sometimes it tends to give big weights that are suboptimal with regard to diversification. The user must exercise caution when using the Kelly criterion. You can also use a deflator to decrease the size given by the formula.</p>
<p><em>The hit ratio technique</em>: This is a personal<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="clustering of performance, and hit ratio position sizing technique" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847230048"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hit ratio" data-secondary="in position sizing" data-secondary-sortas="position sizing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847228944"/> technique that I use from time to time. It is based on the <em>clustering of performance</em>, which means that, generally, profitable trades come together and so do bad trades. This can be true especially because some strategies perform well during certain periods and bad during others. In essence, this is like saying that traders sometimes have good periods and sometimes they are on the losing side, as happens to the most experienced veterans. <a data-type="xref" href="#table12-1">Table 12-1</a> illustrates how to use the hit ratio technique to size your positions.</p>

<p>The table shows the recommended position size with regard to a default size of $10,000 per trade. Basically, when you have a historical hit ratio of 50%, the system recommends 50% allocation of the default size, or $5,000. The system rewards the trader with more allocation and size in case of good results<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_size_position" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847729520"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_position_size" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847728144"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_risk_position_size" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847726768"/>.</p>

<p>Some traders trade based on the news, and therefore they like to trade ahead of news releases or seconds after them in order to profit from volatility. Risk management-wise, this is not recommended as fluctuations are random around news events, which can surprise the markets from time to time.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to avoid trading around the times of an important release that has historically caused some extreme variations. Examples may include political announcements, GDP numbers, and FOMC meetings<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_risk_man_ch12" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762848176864"/>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Behavioral Finance: The Power of Biases" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46762847355488">
<h1>Behavioral Finance: The Power of Biases</h1>
<p><em>Behavioral finance</em>, a field<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trade psychology" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_trade_psych"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="behavioral finance" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_behave_fin"/> stemming from behavioral economics, attempts to explain market anomalies and traders’ actions. By having a deep understanding of behavioral finance, you will better understand why the market reacts the way it does, especially around certain events and levels. According to behavioral finance, patterns are psychological in nature and are therefore caused by behavioral traits.</p>
<p>Financial markets are composed of the actions and reactions of different human and robotic participants, which makes for a psychological and quantitative stew. This explains the low signal-to-noise ratio—in other words, why it is difficult to accurately forecast the market on a regular basis. These actions and reactions are also referred to as <em>biases</em>, and they are human shortcomings in response to certain events.</p>
<p>Biases are the main protagonists of this section, and they are divided into two <span class="keep-together">categories</span>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Cognitive biases</dt>
<dd>These biases<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cognitive biases" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_cog_bias"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="biases" data-secondary="cognitive" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_bias_cog"/> come from a lack of knowledge. Cognitive biases generally involve incorrect conclusions based on wrong market assumptions or bad research.</dd>
<dt>Emotional biases</dt>
<dd>These<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="biases" data-secondary="emotional" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846751168"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="emotional biases" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847173200"/> biases are mostly feelings driven and are impulsive in nature. They are not caused by a lack of education but by a lack of self-control and self-management.</dd>
</dl>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Cognitive Biases" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46762847171712">
<h2>Cognitive Biases</h2>
<p>This subsection lists some of the most common cognitive biases and their market impact and offers recommendations on how to avoid them:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Conservatism bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="conservatism bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847168816"/> when a market participant is slow to react to new information and places too much weight on base rates. It is a type of failure-to-adapt. The way to deal with this bias to force yourself to be skeptical of the basic analysis and to always be dynamic and ready for change. The market does not always behave as it did in the past since it is forward looking.</dd>
<dt>Confirmation bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="confirmation bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847459024"/> when the trader focuses on the type of information that benefits their ongoing position and dismisses the type of information that is not favorable to their position. This is by far one of the most common biases and is actually a normal state of mind that leads to overconfidence over time. The best way to remedy this is to remain impartial and neutral, which is easier said than done. Another way is to automate the decision-making process through scorecards highlighting the attractiveness (or not) of the analyzed underlying assets. Humans in general suffer from this bias—it is not just finance specific.</dd>
<dt>Illusion of control bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="illusion of control bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847456928"/> when the trader overestimates their ability to control the trade outcome. Mainly caused by a streak of winning trades, this bias can lead to concentrated positions due to a sense of power over the invested asset. Markets are composed of a huge number of participants with trillions of invested dollars and as such are unlikely to be impacted by any single person (there are a few, very rare exceptions involving small and illiquid assets). The way to remove the <span class="keep-together">illusion</span> of control is to stay focused and humble and understand that you are facing a semirandom environment that changes its dynamics and drivers every day.</dd>
<dt>Hindsight bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hindsight bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847453984"/> when a trader overestimates their past accuracy and can lead to excessive risk-taking. It is easy to look at past charts and conclude that the subsequent direction was obvious. Most back-tests include a form of hindsight bias since conditions were created at the end of the analyzed period. Market technicians overestimate their abilities when they see that some techniques worked well in the past but fail to take into account the environment of the tested period. Also, some configurations do not look the same when they’re happening as when they are complete. Hindsight bias can be hard to cure, but the best way is to take into consideration the variables that were present during the analyzed period to simulate the past environment in a more realistic way.</dd>
<dt>Anchoring bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="anchoring bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846743680"/> when the trader’s opinion is anchored to a certain base point and fails to change to incorporate new information. As I have mentioned, the analyst or trader must maintain a dynamic and open mindset. The best way to cure this bias is to stay up-to-date with regard to new information and pieces of data.</dd>
<dt>Mental accounting bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="mental accounting bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846741232"/> when traders give different values to the same amount of money because it is allocated into different funds. For example, people generally treat money earned through work and money earned without work differently. This is a cognitive bias. The best way to remedy this is to treat all money as fungible when allocating it to separate portfolios.</dd>
<dt>Availability bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="availability bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846739104"/> when the trader selects positions based on how easily the trader can retrieve memories of them. This means that familiar assets are more attractive than nonfamiliar assets, which is a wrong assumption as opportunities may come from any type of market. It is a type of mental shortcut where the trader does not expend much effort in research. To cure this bias, you must practice full due diligence before selecting a universe of investable assets. Do not just trade the EURUSD because you are familiar with it: expand your horizons.</dd>
<dt>Loss aversion bias<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch12.xhtml#idm46762846737424" id="idm46762846737424-marker">1</a></sup></dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="loss aversion bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846371152"/> when the pain of losing is greater than the joy of winning. It is by far the most common bias. Humans are known to prefer not to lose money than to gain money as was demonstrated in “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Making Under Risk” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1977). Loss <span class="keep-together">aversion</span> could lead to decreased risk taking and therefore decreased expected return. However, the most significant effect is on the stop levels. Loss-averse humans do not want to accept that they are losing money and will see a losing position as an ongoing position and, therefore, prefer to wait until it turns positive. This is highly dangerous as leaving positions without a stop-loss levels could lead to disastrous results. In addition, some people close out of winning positions too fast in fear that they will turn negative (a form of fear of regret). The best way to handle loss aversion is to automate the risk management process and to respect the stop-loss and target orders established at the initiation of the trade<a contenteditable="false" data-startref="ix_bias_cog" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846368880"/><a contenteditable="false" data-startref="ix_cog_bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846367776"/>.</dd>

As a reminder, while cognitive biases are related to a lack of  knowledge, emotional biases are related to psychological traits:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Overconfidence bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="overconfidence bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847048752"/> when a trader enjoys a winning streak and believes it is due to their superior ability to trade the markets, which leads to holding concentrated positions and excessive trading. A good streak will come to an end, and thus the trader must always follow procedures and ensure they do not stray from the strategy.</dd>
<dt>Regret-aversion bias</dt>
<dd>This refers<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="regret-aversion bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847538368"/> to staying in low-risk investments out of fear. This really is all about the risk profile of the trader. There is no right or wrong answer, but the fear of regret can make the trader lose out on interesting opportunities. You should take risks to make money, but only calculated risks.</dd>
<dt>Endowment bias</dt>
<dd>This occurs<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="endowment bias" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847535936"/> when the trader believes that the owned assets are more valuable than the ones that are not owned. This may hamper the trader’s opportunities and cause them to be limited to the assets they already own, even if they decay over time. The market has opportunities everywhere, and participants must always be on the lookout for the next big thing<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_behave_fin" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847534672"/><a contenteditable="false" data-startref="ix_trade_psych" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847533296"/>.</dd>

<h1>Trading Framework</h1>
<p>Theoretical<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="trading framework" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_trade_frame"/> trading topics, paper trading, and real trading are all different. The aim of any trader is to make real money, and this is harder than it seems. Let’s define these three concepts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Theoretical trading topics</dt>
<dd>This is where<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="theoretical trading topics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847153120"/> the trader thinks about trading strategies and simplifies them in their head. This is where biases are formed, especially hindsight bias.</dd>
<dt>Paper trading</dt>
<dd>This is when<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="paper trading" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847150864"/> the trader simulates trades using a platform. It is very similar to real trading, but the money used is not real, and therefore, it fails to simulate the rush of real-life emotions.</dd>
<dt>Real trading</dt>
<dd>This is when<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="real trading" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762847148736"/> the trader uses actual money through an actual broker to buy and sell assets in an attempt to increase wealth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Real trading has the following chronological steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Idea generation</em>: This<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="idea generation phase, real trading" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846307200"/> is where strategy ideas are formed. For example, you think about combining the Tweezers pattern with a technical indicator in a certain market regime. You have formed an idea, and now you want to back-test it to see if it performed well in the past.</li>
<li><em>Back-testing</em>: In this phase<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="back-testing" data-secondary="in real trading" data-secondary-sortas="real trading" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46762846305264"/>, you evaluate past results and decide whether to take the strategy live or not. This is perhaps the most important step because it involves many factors, such as proper back-testing practices and validation, as well as back-testing with risk management techniques.</li>
