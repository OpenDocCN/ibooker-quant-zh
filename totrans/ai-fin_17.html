<h1><span class="label">Part V. </span>Outlook</h1>

<div class="partintro">
<p>This part of the book serves as an epilogue. It provides an outlook on the consequences that the widespread adoption of AI in finance could have. It is concerned primarily, as is the rest of the book, with the trading domain to keep the discussion focused. This final part consists of two chapters:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch13.xhtml#ai_based_competition">Chapter 13</a> discusses aspects of AI-driven competition in the financial industry, such as new requirements for finance education or competitive scenarios that might arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch14.xhtml#financial_singularity">Chapter 14</a> considers the prospect of a financial singularity and the emergence of an artificial financial intelligence—a trading bot consistently generating profits through algorithmic trading well beyond known human or institutional 
<span class="keep-together">capabilities</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This part is largely speculative, argues on a high level, and neglects many relevant and interesting details. It can serve, however, as a starting point for a more in-depth discussion and analysis of the important topics addressed in it.</p>
