<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="AI-based competition in finance" id="ix_AI_competition"/>This chapter addresses topics related to competition in the financial industry based on the systematic and strategic application of AI. <a data-type="xref" href="#ai_and_finance">“AI and Finance”</a> serves as a review and summary of the importance that AI might have for the future of finance. <a data-type="xref" href="#lack_of_standardization">“Lack of Standardization”</a> argues that AI in finance is still at a nascent stage, making the implementation in many instances anything but straightforward. This, on the other hand, leaves the competitive landscape wide open for financial players to secure competitive advantages through AI. The rise of AI in finance requires a rethinking and redesign of finance education and training. Today’s requirements cannot be met anymore by traditional finance curricula. <a data-type="xref" href="#fight_for_resources">“Fight for Resources”</a> discusses how financial institutions will fight for necessary resources to apply AI at a large scale in finance. As in many other areas, AI experts are often the bottleneck for which financial companies compete with technology companies, startups, and companies from other industries.</p>

<h1>AI and Finance</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="areas of AI application" id="ix_fin_ind_AI_app"/>This book primarily focuses on the use of AI in finance as applied to the prediction of financial time series. The goal is to discover <em>statistical inefficiencies</em>, situations in which the AI algorithm outperforms a baseline algorithm in predicting future market movements. Such statistical inefficiencies are the basis for <em>economic inefficiencies</em>. An economic inefficiency requires that there be a trading strategy that can exploit the statistical inefficiency in such a way that above-market returns are realized. In other words, there is a strategy—composed of the prediction algorithm and an execution algorithm—that generates <em>alpha</em>.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other areas in which AI algorithms can be applied to finance. Examples include the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Credit scoring</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="credit scoring, applying AI to" id="idm45625239083384"/>AI algorithms can be used to derive credit scores for potential debtors, thereby supporting credit decisions or even fully automating them. For example, Golbayani et al. (2020) apply a neural network–based approach to corporate credit ratings, whereas Babaev et al. (2019) use RNNs in the context of retail loan 
<span class="keep-together">applications.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt>Fraud detection</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fraud detection, applying AI to" id="idm45625239840536"/>AI algorithms can identify unusual patterns (for example, in transactions related to credit cards), thereby preventing fraud from remaining undetected or even from happening. Yousefi et al. (2019) provide a survey of the literature on the topic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Trade execution</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution of trading algorithms" data-secondary="applying AI to" id="idm45625239838280"/>AI algorithms can learn how to best execute trades related to large blocks of shares, for example, thereby minimizing market impact and transaction costs. The paper by Ning et al. (2020) applies a double deep Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal trade execution policies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Derivatives hedging</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="derivatives hedging, applying AI to" id="idm45625239835720"/>AI algorithms can be trained to optimally execute hedge transactions for single derivative instruments or portfolios composed of such instruments. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deep hedging" id="idm45625239834712"/>The approach is often called <em>deep hedging</em>. Buehler et al. (2019) apply a reinforcement learning approach to implement deep hedging.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Portfolio management</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="portfolios" data-secondary="applying AI to management of" id="idm45625239832232"/>AI algorithms can be used to compose and rebalance portfolios of financial instruments, say, in the context of long-term retirement savings plans. The recent book by López de Prado (2020) covers this topic in detail.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Customer service</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="customer service, applying AI to" id="idm45625239829672"/>AI algorithms can be used to process natural language, such as in the context of customer inquiries. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chat bots" id="idm45625239234424"/>Chat bots have therefore—like in many other industries—become quite popular in finance. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) model" id="idm45625239233512"/>The paper by Yu et al. (2020) discusses a financial chat bot based on the popular <em>bidirectional encoder representations from transformers</em> (BERT) model, which has its origin within Google.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>All these application areas of AI in finance and others not listed here benefit from the programmatic availability of large amounts of relevant data. Why can we expect machine, deep, and reinforcement learning algorithms to perform better than traditional methods from financial econometrics, such as OLS regression? There are a number of reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Big data</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="big data" id="idm45625239229848"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="in finance and use of AI" data-secondary-sortas="finance and use of AI" id="idm45625239228872"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="big data" id="idm45625239227688"/>While traditional statistical methods can often cope with larger data sets, they at the same time do not benefit too much performance-wise from increasing data volumes. On the other hand, neural network–based approaches often benefit 
<span class="keep-together">tremendously</span> when trained on larger data sets with regard to the relevant performance metrics.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Instability</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="instability of data, AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239224792"/>Financial markets, in contrast to the physical world, do not follow constant laws. They are rather changing over time, sometimes in rapid fashion. AI algorithms can take this more easily into account by incrementally updating neural networks through online training, for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nonlinearity</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="non-linearity of relationships, AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239027720"/>OLS regression, for example, assumes an inherent linear relationship between the features and the labels data. AI algorithms, such as neural networks, can in general more easily cope with nonlinear relationships.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nonnormality</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="non-normality of data, AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239025544"/>In financial econometrics, the assumption of normally distributed variables is ubiquitous. AI algorithms in general do not rely that much on such constraining assumptions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>High dimensionality</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="high dimensionality of data, AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239023400"/>Traditional methods from financial econometrics have proven useful for problems characterized by low dimensionality. Many problems in finance are cast into a context with a pretty low number of features (independent variables), such as one (CAPM) or maybe a few more. More advanced AI algorithms can easily deal with problems characterized by high dimensionality, taking into account even several hundred different features if required.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Classification problems</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="classification task" data-secondary="AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239021000"/>The toolbox of traditional econometrics is mainly based on approaches for estimation (regression) problems. These problems for sure form an important category in finance. However, classification problems are probably equally important. The toolbox of machine and deep learning provides a large menu of options for attacking classification problems.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unstructured data</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unstructured data" data-secondary="AI’s ability to adjust to" id="idm45625239018408"/>Traditional methods from financial econometrics can basically only deal with structured, numerical data. Machine and deep learning algorithms are able to also efficiently handle unstructured, text-based data. They can also handle both structured and unstructured data efficiently at the same time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Although the application of AI is in many parts of finance still at a nascent stage, some areas of application have proven to benefit tremendously from the paradigm shift to AI-first finance. It is therefore relatively safe to predict that machine, deep, and reinforcement learning algorithms will significantly reshape the way finance is approached and conducted in practice. Furthermore, AI has become the number one instrument in the pursuit of competitive advantages.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_AI_app" id="idm45625239621448"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Lack of Standardization"><div class="sect1" id="lack_of_standardization">
<h1>Lack of Standardization</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="lack of AI standardization in" id="ix_fin_ind_AIstandard"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithmic trading" data-secondary="lack of research standardization" id="ix_alg_trade_standard"/>Traditional, normative finance (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#normative_finance">Chapter 3</a>) has reached a high degree of standardization. There are a number of textbooks available on different formal levels that 
<span class="keep-together">basically</span> teach and explain the very same theories and models. Two examples in this context are Copeland et al. (2005) and Jones (2012). The theories and models in turn rely in general on research papers published over the previous decades.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model" id="idm45625239614088"/>When Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973) published their theories and models to price European option contracts with a closed-form analytical formula, the financial industry immediately accepted the formula and the ideas behind it as a benchmark. Almost 50 years later, with many improved theories and models suggested in between, the Black-Scholes-Merton model and formula are still considered to be <em>a</em> benchmark, if not <em>the</em> benchmark, in option pricing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, AI-first finance lacks a noticeable degree of standardization. There are numerous research papers published essentially on a daily basis (for example, on 
<span class="orm-hide-url"><a href="http://arxiv.org"><em class="hyperlink">http://arxiv.org</em></a></span>). Among other reasons, this is due to the fact that traditional publication venues with peer review are in general too slow to keep up with the fast pace in the field of AI. Researchers are keen to share their work with the public as fast as possible, often to not be outpaced by competing teams. A peer review process, which also has its merits in terms of quality assurance, might take months, during which the research would not be published. In that sense, researchers more and more trust in the community to take care of the review while also ensuring early credit for their discoveries.</p>

<p>Whereas it was not unusual decades ago that a new finance working paper circulated for years among experts before being peer reviewed and finally published, today’s research environment is characterized by much faster turnaround times and the willingness of researchers to put out work early that might not have been thoroughly reviewed and tested by others. As a consequence, there are hardly any standards or benchmark implementations available for the multitude of AI algorithms that are being applied to financial problems.</p>

<p>These fast research publication cycles are in large part driven by the easy applicability of AI algorithms to financial data. Students, researchers, and practitioners hardly need more than a typical consumer notebook to apply the latest breakthroughs in AI to the financial domain. This is an advantage when compared to the constraints of econometric research some decades ago (in the form of limited data availability and limited compute power, for example). But it also often leads to the idea of “throwing as much spaghetti as possible at the wall” in the hope that some might stick.</p>

<p>To some extent, the eagerness and urgency are also caused by investors, pushing investment managers to come up with new investment approaches at a faster pace. This often requires the dismissal of traditional research approaches in finance in favor of more practical approaches. As Lopéz de Prado (2018) puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problem: Mathematical proofs can take years, decades, and centuries. No investor will wait that long.</p>

<p>Solution: Use experimental math. Solve hard, intractable problems, not by proof but by experiment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Overall, the lack of standardization provides ample opportunity for single financial players to exploit the advantages of AI-first finance in a competitive context. At the time of this writing in mid-2020, it feels like the race to leverage AI to revolutionize how finance is approached is moving at full speed. The remainder of this chapter addresses important aspects of AI-based competition beyond those of this and the previous section.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_alg_trade_standard" id="idm45625239548344"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_AIstandard" id="idm45625239547368"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Education and Training"><div class="sect1" id="education_and_training">
<h1>Education and Training</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="education and training" id="ix_fin_ind_ed-train"/>Entering the field of finance and the financial industry happens quite often via a formal education in the field. Typical degrees have names such as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Master of Finance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of Quantitative Finance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of Computational Finance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of Financial Engineering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of Quantitative Enterprise Risk Management</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, all such degrees today require the students to master at least one programming language, often Python, to address the data processing requirements of data-driven finance. In this regard, universities address the demand for these skills from the industry. Murray (2019) points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The workforce will have to adapt as companies use artificial intelligence for more tasks.</p>

<p>[T]here are opportunities for Master’s in Finance (MiF) graduates. The blend of technological and financial knowledge is a sweet spot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the highest demand comes from quantitative investors that use AI to trawl markets and colossal data sets to identify potential trades.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not only universities that adjust their curricula in finance-related degrees to include programming, data science, and AI. The companies themselves also invest heavily in training programs for new and existing staff to be ready for data-driven and AI-first finance. Noonan (2018) describes the large-scale training efforts of JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest banks in the world, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is putting hundreds of new investment bankers and asset managers through mandatory coding lessons, in a sign of Wall Street’s heightened need for technology skills.</p>

<p>With technology, from artificial intelligence trading to online lending platforms, shaping the future of banking, financial services groups are developing software to help them boost efficiency, create innovative products and fend off the threat from start-ups and tech giants.</p>

<p>The coding training for this year’s juniors was based on Python programming, which will help them to analyze very large data sets and interpret unstructured data such as free language text. Next year, the asset management division will expand the mandatory tech training to include data science concepts, machine learning and cloud 
<span class="keep-together">computing.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In summary, more and more roles in the financial industry will require staff skilled in programming, basic and advanced data science concepts, machine learning, and other technical aspects, such as cloud computing. Universities and financial institutions on both the buy and sell sides react to this trend by adjusting their curricula and by investing heavily in training their workforces, respectively. In both cases, it is a matter of competing effectively—or even of staying relevant and being able to survive—in a financial landscape changed for good by the increasing importance of AI.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_ed-train" id="idm45625239107112"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Fight for Resources"><div class="sect1" id="fight_for_resources">
<h1>Fight for Resources</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="resource competition" id="ix_fin_ind_resources"/>In the quest to make use of AI in a scalable, significant way in finance, players in the financial markets compete for the best resources. Four major resources are of paramount importance: human resources, algorithms, data, and hardware.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="human resources (financial technology experts)" id="idm45625238948248"/>Probably the most important and, at the same time, scarcest resource is experts in AI in general and AI for finance in particular. In this regard, financial institutions compete with technology companies, financial technology (fintech) startups, and other groups for the best talent. Although banks are generally prepared to pay relatively high salaries to such experts, cultural aspects of technology companies and, for example, the promise of stock options in startups might make it difficult for them to attract top talent. Often, financial institutions resort to nurturing talent internally.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ML (machine learning)" data-secondary="finding resources for" id="idm45625238946456"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithms, generally" id="idm45625238945480"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DL (deep learning)" data-secondary="finding resources for" id="idm45625238944808"/>Many algorithms and models in machine and deep learning can be considered standard algorithms that are well researched, tested, and documented. In many instances, however, it is not clear from the outset how to apply them best in a financial context. This is where financial institutions invest heavily in research efforts. For many of the larger buy-side institutions, such as systematic hedge funds, investment and trading strategy research is at the very core of their business models. However, as <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.xhtml#execution_deployment">Chapter 12</a> shows, deployment and production are of equal importance. Both strategy research and deployment are, of course, highly technical disciplines in this context.</p>

<p>Algorithms without data are often worthless. Similarly, algorithms with “standard” data from typical data sources, such as exchanges or data service providers like Refinitiv or Bloomberg, might only be of limited value. This is due to the fact that such data is intensively analyzed by many, if not all, relevant players in the market, making it hard or even impossible to identify alpha-generating opportunities or similar competitive advantage. As a consequence, large buy-side institutions invest particularly heavily in getting access to <em>alternative data</em> (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#data_availability">“Data Availability”</a>).</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="resources for finance industry" id="idm45625238977032"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="alternative data sources" id="idm45625238975992"/>How important alternative data is considered to be nowadays is reflected in investments that buy-side players and other investors make in companies active in the field. For example, in 2018 a group of investment companies invested $95 million in the data group Enigma. Fortado (2018) describes the deal and its rationale as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hedge funds, banks and venture capital firms are piling into investments in data companies in the hope of cashing in on a business they are using a lot more themselves.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a proliferation of start-ups that trawl through reams of data and sell it to investment groups searching for an edge.</p>

<p>The latest to attract investor interest is Enigma, a New York-based start-up that received funding from sources including quant giant Two Sigma, activist hedge fund Third Point and venture capital firms NEA and Glynn Capital in a $95m capital raising announced on Tuesday.</p></blockquote>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hardware" data-secondary="resource competition" id="idm45625238972392"/>The fourth resource that financial institutions are competing for is the best hardware options to process big financial data, implement the algorithms based on traditional and alternative data sets, and thereby apply AI efficiently to finance. Recent years have seen tremendous innovation in hardware dedicated to making machine and deep learning efforts faster, more energy-efficient, and more cost-effective. While traditional processors, such as CPUs, play a minor role in the field, specialized hardware such as <a href="https://nvidia.com">GPUs by Nvidia</a> or newer options such as <a href="https://oreil.ly/3HHUy">TPUs by Google</a> and <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai">IPUs by startup Graphcore</a> have taken over in AI. The interest of financial institutions in new, specialized hardware is, for example, reflected in the research efforts of Citadel, one of the largest hedge funds and market makers, into IPUs. Its effort are documented in the comprehensive research report Jia et al. (2019), which illustrates the potential benefits of 
<span class="keep-together">specialized</span> hardware compared to alternative options.</p>

<p>In the race to dominance in AI-first finance, financial institutions invest billions per year in talent, research, data, and hardware. Whereas large institutions seem well positioned to keep up with the pace in the field, smaller or medium-sized players will find it hard to comprehensively shift to an AI-first approach to their business.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_resources" id="idm45625238966856"/></p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Market Impact"><div class="sect1" id="market_impact">
<h1>Market Impact</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="market impact of AI" id="idm45625240801240"/>The increasing and now widespread usage of data science, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms in the financial industry without a doubt has an impact on financial markets, investment, and trading opportunities. As the many examples in this book illustrate, ML and DL methods are able to discover statistical inefficiencies and even economic inefficiencies that are not discoverable by traditional econometric methods, such as multivariate OLS regression. It is therefore to be assumed that new and better analysis methods make it harder to discover alpha-generating opportunities and strategies.</p>

<p>Comparing the current situation in financial markets with the one in gold mining, Lopéz de Prado (2018) describes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a decade ago it was relatively common for an individual to discover macroscopic alpha (i.e., using simple mathematical tools like econometrics), currently the chances of that happening are quickly converging to zero. Individuals searching nowadays 
<span class="keep-together">for macroscopic</span> alpha, regardless of their experience or knowledge, are fighting 
<span class="keep-together">overwhelming</span> odds. The only true alpha left is microscopic, and finding it requires capital-intensive industrial methods. Just like with gold, microscopic alpha does not mean smaller overall profits. Microscopic alpha today is much more abundant than macroscopic alpha has ever been in history. There is a lot of money to be made, but you will need
to use heavy ML tools.</p></blockquote>

<p>Against this background, financial institutions almost seem to be required to embrace AI-first finance to not be left behind and eventually maybe even go out of business. This holds true not only in investing and trading, but in other areas as well. While banks historically have nurtured long-term relationships with commercial and retail debtors and organically built their ability to make sound credit decisions, AI today levels the playing field and renders long-term relationships almost worthless. Therefore, new entrants in the field, such as fintech startups, relying on AI can often quickly grab market share from incumbents in a controlled, viable fashion. On the other hand, these developments incentivize incumbents to acquire and merge younger, innovative fintech startups to stay competitive.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Competitive Scenarios"><div class="sect1" id="competitive_scenarios">
<h1>Competitive Scenarios</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="competitive scenarios for AI" id="ix_fin_ind_AI_scenarios"/>Looking forward, say, three to five years, how might the competitive landscape driven by AI-first finance look? Three scenarios are come to mind:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Monopoly</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="monopoly, AI-first finance landscape as" id="idm45625238901480"/>One financial institution reaches a dominant position through major, unmatched breakthroughs in applying AI to, say, algorithmic trading. This is, for example, the situation in internet searches, where Google has a global market share of about 90%.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Oligopoly</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="oligopoly, AI-first finance landscape as" id="idm45625238899256"/>A smaller number of financial institutions are able to leverage AI-first finance to achieve leading positions. An oligopoly is, for example, also present in the hedge fund industry, in which a small number of large players dominate the field in terms of assets under management.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perfect competition</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perfect competition, AI-first finance landscape as" id="idm45625238896952"/>All players in the financial markets benefit from advances in AI-first finance in similar fashion. No single player or group of players enjoys any competitive advantages compared to others. Technologically speaking, this is comparable to the situation in computer chess nowadays. A number of chess programs, running on standard hardware such as smartphones, are significantly better at playing chess than the current world champion (Magnus Carlsen at the time of this 
<span class="keep-together">writing).</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is hard to forecast which scenario is more likely. One can find arguments and describe possible paths for all three of them. For example, an argument for a monopoly might be that a major breakthrough in algorithmic trading, for example, might lead to a fast, significant outperformance that helps accumulate more capital through reinvestments, as well as through new inflows. This in turn increases the available technology and research budget to protect the competitive advantage and attracts talent that would be otherwise hard to win over. This whole cycle is self-reinforcing, and the example of Google in search—in connection with the core online advertising business—is a good one in this context.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are good reasons to anticipate an oligopoly. Currently, it is safe to assume that any large player in the trading business invests heavily in research and technology, with AI-related initiatives making up a significant part of the budget. As in other fields, say, recommender engines—think Amazon for books, Netflix for films, and Spotify for music—multiple companies might be able to reach similar breakthroughs at the same time. It is conceivable that the current leading systemic traders will be able to use AI-first finance to cement their leading positions.</p>

<p>Finally, many technologies have become ubiquitous over the years. Strong chess programs are only one example. Others might be maps and navigation systems or speech-based personal assistants. In a perfect competition scenario, a pretty large number of financial players would compete for minuscule alpha-creating opportunities or even might be unable to generate returns distinguishable from plain market returns.</p>

<p>At the same time, there are arguments against the three scenarios. The current landscape has many players with equal means and incentives to leverage AI in finance. This makes it unlikely that only a single player will stand out and grab market share in investment management that is comparable to Google in search. At the same time, the number of small, medium-sized, and large players doing research in the field and the low barriers of entry in algorithmic trading make it unlikely that a select few can secure defendable competitive advantages. An argument against perfect competition is that, in the foreseeable future, algorithmic trading at a large scale requires a huge amount of capital and other resources. With regard to chess, DeepMind has shown with AlphaZero that there is always room for innovation and significant improvements, even if a field almost seems settled once and for all.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_AI_scenarios" id="idm45625238890632"/></p>

<h1>Risks, Regulation, and Oversight</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="AI (artificial intelligence)" data-secondary="risks, regulation, and oversight issues" id="ix_AI_finance_risk_reg"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="finance industry" data-secondary="risks, regulation, and oversight issues for AI" id="ix_fin_ind_AI_risks"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="risks of AI in finance" id="ix_risk_AI_finance"/>A simple Google search reveals that there is an active discourse going on about the risks of AI and its regulation in general, as well as in the financial services industry.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45625239347032-marker" href="ch13.xhtml#idm45625239347032">1</a></sup> This section cannot address all relevant aspects in this context, but it can address at least a few important ones.</p>

<p>The following are some of the risks that the application of AI in finance introduces:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Privacy</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="privacy risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625239342632"/>Finance is a sensitive area with tight privacy laws. The use of AI at a large scale requires the use of—at least partly—private data from customers. This increases the risk that private data will be leaked or used in inappropriate ways. Such a risk obviously does not arise when publicly available data sources, such as for financial time series data, are used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Bias</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bias risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625238801848"/>AI algorithms can easily learn biases that are inherent in data related, for example, to retail or corporate customers. Algorithms can only be as good and as objective in, say, judging the creditworthiness of a potential debtor as the data allows.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45625238800792-marker" href="ch13.xhtml#idm45625238800792">2</a></sup> Again, the problem of learning biases is not really a problem when working with market data, for instance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inexplicability</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="inexplicability risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625238798856"/>In many areas, it is important that decisions can be explained, sometimes in detail and in hindsight. This might be required by law or by investors wanting to understand why particular investment decisions have been taken. Take the example of investment and trading decisions. If an AI, based on a large neural 
<span class="keep-together">network,</span> decides <em>algorithmically</em> when and what to trade, it might be pretty difficult and often impossible to explain in detail why the AI has traded the way it has. Researchers work actively and intensively on <a href="https://oreil.ly/P3YFQ">“explainable AI,”</a> but there are obvious limits in this regard.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Herding</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="herding risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625238794440"/>Since the stock market crash of 1987, it is clear what kind of risk herding in financial trading represents. In 1987, positive feedback trading in the context of large-scale synthetic replication programs for put options—in combination with stop loss orders—triggered the downward spiral. A similar herding effect could be observed in the 2008 hedge fund meltdown, which for the first time revealed the extent to which different hedge funds implement similar kinds of strategies. With regard to the flash crash in 2010, for which algorithmic trading was blamed by some, the evidence seems unclear. However, the more widespread use of AI in trading might pose a similar risk when more and more institutions apply similar approaches that have proven fruitful. Other areas are also prone to such an effect. Credit decision agents might learn the same biases based on different data sets and might make it impossible for certain groups or individuals to get credit at all.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vanishing alpha</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="vanishing alpha risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625238791448"/>As has been argued before, the more widespread use of AI in finance at ever larger scales might make alpha in the markets disappear. Techniques must get better, and data may become “more alternative” to secure any competitive advantage. <a data-type="xref" href="ch14.xhtml#financial_singularity">Chapter 14</a> takes a closer look at this in the context of a potential <em>financial singularity</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regulation and oversight of AI in finance" id="idm45625239606360"/>Beyond the typical risks of AI, AI introduces new risks specific to the financial domain. At the same time, it is difficult for lawmakers and regulators to keep up with the developments in the field and to comprehensively assess individual and systemic risks arising from AI-first finance. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Know-how</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="know-how risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625239603336"/>Lawmakers and regulators need to acquire, like the financial players themselves, new know-how related to AI in finance. In this respect, they compete with the big financial institutions and technology companies that are known to pay salaries well above the possibilities of lawmakers and regulators.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Insufficient data</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="insufficient data risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625239601064"/>In many application areas, there is simply little or even no data available that watchdogs can use to judge the real impact of AI. In some instances, it might not even be known whether AI plays a role or not. And even if it is known and data might be available, it might be hard to separate the impact of AI from the impact of other relevant factors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Little transparency</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="transparency risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625239598744"/>While almost all financial institutions try to make use of AI to secure or gain competitive advantages, it is hardly ever transparent what a single institution does in this regard and how exactly it is implemented and used. Many treat their effort in this context as intellectual property and their own “secret sauce.”</p>
</dd>
<dt>Model validation</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="model validation risk of AI in finance" id="idm45625239596456"/>Model validation is a central risk management and regulatory tool in many financial areas. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model" id="idm45625238814264"/>Take the simple example of the pricing of a European option based on the Black-Scholes-Merton (1973) option pricing model. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Cox-Ross-Rubenstein binomial option pricing model" id="idm45625238813288"/>The prices that a specific implementation of the model generates can be validated, for example, by the use of the Cox et al. (1979) binomial option pricing model—and vice versa. This is often quite different with AI algorithms. There is hardly ever a model that, based on a parsimonious set of parameters, can validate the outputs of a complex AI algorithm. Reproducibility might be, however, an attainable goal (that is, the option to have third parties verify the outputs based on an exact replication of all steps involved). But this in turn would require the third party, say, a regulator or an auditor, to have access to the same data, an infrastructure as powerful as the one used by the financial institution, and so on. For larger AI efforts, this seems simply unrealistic.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_risk_AI_finance" id="idm45625238811656"/></p>
</dd>
<dt>Hard to regulate</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="regulation and oversight of AI in finance" id="idm45625238809560"/>Back to the option pricing example, a regulator can specify that both the Black-Scholes-Merton (1973) and the Cox et al. (1979) option pricing models are acceptable for the pricing of European options. Even when lawmakers and regulators specify that both support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and neural networks are “acceptable algorithms,” this leaves open how these algorithms are trained, used, and so on. It is difficult to be more specific in this context. For example, should a regulator limit the number of hidden layers and/or hidden units in a neural network? What about the software packages to be used? The list of hard questions seems endless. Therefore, only general rules will be formulated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Technology companies and financial institutions alike usually prefer a more lax approach to AI regulation—for often obvious reasons. In Bradshaw (2019), Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks of “smart” regulation and asks for an approach that differentiates between different industries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google’s chief executive has warned politicians against knee-jerk regulation of artificial intelligence, arguing that existing rules may be sufficient to govern the new technology.</p>

<p>Sundar Pichai said that AI required “smart regulation” that balanced innovation with protecting citizens…."It is such a broad cross-cutting technology, so it’s important to look at [regulation] more in certain vertical situations,” Mr Pichai said.</p></blockquote>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Musk, Elon" id="idm45625238805400"/>On the other hand, there are popular proponents of a more stringent regulation of AI, such as Elon Musk in Matyus (2020):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mark my words,” Musk warned. “A.I. is far more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight?”</p></blockquote>

<p>The risks from AI in finance are manifold, as are the problems faced by lawmakers and regulators. Nevertheless, it is safe to predict that tighter regulation and oversight addressing AI in finance specifically is certainly to come in many jurisdictions.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_AI_competition" id="idm45625238777928"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_AI_finance_risk_reg" id="idm45625238776952"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="" data-startref="ix_fin_ind_AI_risks" id="idm45625238776008"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Conclusions"><div class="sect1" id="idm45625239351944">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>This chapter addresses aspects of using AI to compete in the financial industry. The benefits are clear in many application areas. However, so far hardly any standards have been established, and the field seems still wide open for players to strive for competitive advantages. Because new technologies and approaches from data science, machine learning, deep learning, and more generally AI infiltrate almost any financial discipline, education and training in finance must take this into account. Many master’s programs have already adjusted their curricula, while big financial institutions invest heavily in training incoming and existing staff in the required skills. Beyond human resources, financial institutions also compete for other resources in the field, such as alternative data. In the financial markets, AI-powered investment and trading make it harder to identify sustainable alpha opportunities. On the other hand, with traditional econometric methods it might be impossible today to identify and mine microscopic alpha.</p>

<p>It is difficult to predict a competitive end scenario for the financial industry at a point when AI has taken over. Scenarios ranging from a monopoly to an oligopoly to perfect competition seem still reasonable. <a data-type="xref" href="ch14.xhtml#financial_singularity">Chapter 14</a> revisits this topic. AI-first finance confronts researchers, practitioners, and regulators with new risks and new challenges in addressing these risks appropriately. One such risk, playing a prominent role in many discussions, is the black box characteristic of many AI algorithms. Such a risk usually can only be mitigated to some extent with today’s state-of-the-art explainable AI.</p>
