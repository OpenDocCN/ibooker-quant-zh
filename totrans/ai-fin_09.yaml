- en: The major goal of this part is to apply neural networks and reinforcement learning
    to discover statistical inefficiencies in financial markets (data). A *statistical
    inefficiency*, for the purposes of this book, is found when a *predictor* (a model
    or algorithm in general or a neural network in particular) predicts markets significantly
    better than a random predictor assigning equal probability to upwards and downwards
    movements. In an algorithmic trading context, to have such a predictor available
    is a prerequisite for the generation of *alpha* or above-market returns.

    applies them to the problem of predicting the direction of financial market movements.
    Historical data is used to generate lagged features data and to generate binary
    labels data. Such data sets are then used to train DNNs via supervised learning.
    The focus lies on identifying statistical inefficiencies in financial markets.
    In some of the examples, the DNN achieves an out-of-sample prediction accuracy
    of more than 60%.'

    to accommodate the specific nature of sequential data, such as textual data or
    time series data. The idea is to add some form of memory to the network that carries
    previous (historical) information through the network (layers). The approach taken
    in this chapter is close to the one in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#dense_networks),
    with the same goal of discovering statistical inefficiencies in the financial
    market data. As numerical examples illustrate, RNNs also can reach prediction
    accuracies out-of-sample of more than 60%.'

    success stories in AI. The chapter discusses different RL agents applied to both
    a simulated physical environment from the OpenAI Gym and financial market environments
    as developed in the chapter. The algorithm of choice in RL often is Q-learning,
    which is discussed in detail and applied to train a trading bot. The trading bot
    shows respectable out-of-sample financial performance, which is generally an even
    more important yardstick than prediction accuracy alone. In that sense, the chapter
    builds a natural bridge to [Part IV](part04.xhtml#part_economic_inefficiencies),
    which is concerned with exploiting statistical inefficiencies economically.'

    neural networks* (CNNs) are not discussed in detail in this part. [Appendix C](app03.xhtml#app_convolutional_neural_networks)
    illustrates the application of CNNs in a concise way. In many cases, CNNs can
    also be applied to the problems that DNNs and RNNs are applied to in this part
    of the book.

- en: The approach in this part is a practical one, leaving out many important details
    with regard to the algorithms and techniques applied. This seems justified since
    there are a number of good resources in book form and otherwise available that
    can be consulted for technical details and background information. The chapters
    to follow provide references to a select few, generally comprehensive, resources
    when appropriate.
