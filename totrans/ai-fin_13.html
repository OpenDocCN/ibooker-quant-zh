<p><a data-type="xref" href="part03.xhtml#part_statistical_inefficiencies">Part III</a> is concerned with the discovery of <em>statistical</em> inefficiencies in financial markets by the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques. This part, by contrast, is concerned with identifying and exploiting <em>economic</em> inefficiencies for which statistical inefficiencies are a prerequisite in general. The tool of choice for exploiting economic inefficiencies is <em>algorithmic trading</em>, that is, the automated execution of trading strategies based on predictions generated by a trading bot.</p>

<p>This part consists of three chapters that are structured along the three steps, as illustrated in <a data-type="xref" href="#ei_comparison">Table IV-1</a>, to exploit economic inefficiencies through a trading bot—starting with the vectorized backtesting of trading strategies, covering the analysis of risk management measures through event-based backtesting, and discussing technical details in the context of strategy execution and deployment:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch10.xhtml#vectorized_backtesting">Chapter 10</a> is about the <em>vectorized backtesting</em> of algorithmic trading strategies, such as those based on a DNN for market prediction. This approach is both efficient and insightful with regard to a first judgment of the economic potential of a trading strategy. It also allows one to assess the impact of transaction costs on economic performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch11.xhtml#risk_management">Chapter 11</a> covers central aspects of managing the risk of algorithmic trading strategies, such as the use of stop loss orders or take profit orders. In addition to vectorized backtesting, this chapter introduces event-based backtesting as a more flexible approach to judge the economic potential of a trading strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch12.xhtml#execution_deployment">Chapter 12</a> is primarily about the execution of trading strategies. Topics are the retrieval of historical data, the training of a trading bot based on this data, the streaming of real-time data, and the placement of orders. It introduces <a href="http://oanda.com">Oanda</a> and its API as a trading platform well suited to algorithmic trading. It also covers fundamental aspects of deploying AI-powered algorithmic trading strategies in automatic fashion.</p>
</li>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="algorithmic trading" data-secondary="strategies" id="idm45625275106120"/>Algorithmic trading is a vast field and encompasses different types of trading strategies. Some, for example, try to minimize the market impact during the execution of large orders (liquidity 
<span class="keep-together">algorithms). Others</span> try to replicate the payoff of derivatives instruments as closely as possible (dynamic hedging/replication). These examples illustrate that not all algorithmic trading strategies have the goal of exploiting economic inefficiencies. For the purposes of this book, the focus on algorithmic trading strategies that result from predictions made by a trading bot (for example, in the form of a DNN agent or an RL agent) seems appropriate and useful.</p>
